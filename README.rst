 Flycheck

.. default-role:: code

Flycheck (aka “Flymake done right”) is a modern on-the-fly syntax checking
extension for GNU Emacs 24 with:

- ready-to-use syntax checkers for a bunch of languages,
- easy customization,
- a comprehensive manual,
- a dead simple, declarative API to create new syntax checkers,
- major-mode based selection of syntax checkers,
- multiple syntax checkers per buffer,
- optional error list popup,
- a “doesn’t get in your way” guarantee,
- and a clean, concise and understandable implementation with decent test
  coverage.

   Light color theme and the great `Source Code Pro`_ font.

3rd party extensions
--------------------

The following extensions provide additional cool features for Flycheck:

- flycheck-cask_ makes Flycheck use local packages in Cask_ projects.
- flycheck-color-mode-line_ colors the mode line according to the Flycheck
  status.
- flycheck-d-unittest_ a Flycheck checker to run unit tests for D programs on
  the fly.
- flycheck-hdevtools_ provides a Flycheck syntax checker for hdevtools_.
- flycheck-mercury_ provides a Flycheck syntax checker for the `Mercury
  language`_.

Installation
============

Install the ELPA package from MELPA_ or Marmalade_.  In your Cask_
file:

.. code-block:: cl

   (source gnu)
   (source melpa)

   (depends-on "flycheck")

Flycheck supports Emacs 24.  It is tested with Emacs 24.3, and Emacs snapshot
builds.  It should work with GNU Emacs 24.1 and 24.2 as well, but it is not
tested against these versions.  If it does not work with these versions, please
report an issue.

Flycheck does not support Windows, but tries to be compatible with it.  You may
try to use Flycheck on Windows.  It should mostly work, but expect problems and
issues.  Pull requests which improve Windows compatibility are welcome.

Flycheck also does not support GNU Emacs 23 and other flavors of Emacs
(e.g. XEmacs, Aquamacs, etc.).  Don't try, it will *not* work.

Most checkers have dependencies against external tools that perform the
checking.  Use `C-c ! ?` to see what a checker needs, e.g. `C-c ! ?
python-pylint`.

Usage
=====

Once installed, enable Flycheck mode with `M-x flycheck-mode`.

To enable Flycheck mode in all buffers, in which it can be used, add the
following to your `init.el` file:

.. code-block:: cl

   (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)

In Flycheck mode the buffer will automatically be checked on the fly, if a
suitable syntax checker exists.  Use `C-c ! c` to start a syntax check manually.

A suitable syntax checker is automatically selected from the list of registered
checkers in `flycheck-checkers`.  Use `C-c ! s` to manually select a specific
syntax checker, or configure the syntax checker per file by setting
`flycheck-checker` as file local variable:

.. code-block:: python

   # Local Variables:
   # flycheck-checker: python-pylint
   # End:

Read the section `Syntax checker selection`_ in the Flycheck manual for more
information.

Some syntax checkers read configuration files, or provide options for
customization.  Use `M-x customize-group RET flycheck-config-files` and `M-x
customize-group RET flycheck-options` respectively to customize these.  Refer to
the section `Syntax checker configuration`_ in the Flycheck manual for more
information.

Errors and warnings from the syntax checker are reported in the mode line,
highlighted in the buffer and indicated with icons in the fringe.  Customize
`flycheck-highlighting-mode` and `flycheck-indication-mode` to change the
highlighting and indication of errors.  Also look at `M-x customize-group RET
flycheck-faces` to customize the visual appearance, and read `Error reporting`_
and `Mode line`_ in the Flycheck manual.

**Note:** The default highlighting faces provided GNU Emacs are ill-suited to
highlight errors.  They are too easily overlooked.  Make sure to customize these
faces to add a striking background color or an underlying, or choose a color
theme with reasonable Flycheck faces, for instance the excellent light or dark
Solarized_ themes, or the fancy Zenburn_ theme.

Use `C-c ! n` and `C-c ! p` to navigate between errors, or use `C-c ! l` to list
all errors in a separate buffer.  If the point is on an error, the error message
is shown in the echo area or in a popup buffer after a short delay.  You may
also hover the mouse over a highlighted error to get a tooltip with the error
message.  Read the `Error navigation`_ section in the manual for more
information.

Read the complete manual inside Emacs with `C-c ! i` or `M-x flycheck-info`, or
