The following people significantly contributed to Flycheck in other ways:

- [Matthias Güdemann](https://github.com/mgudemann) (initial version of the
  Flycheck logo, valuable feedback for the final version)
- [Simon Carter](https://github.com/bbbscarter) (valuable testing and feedback
  of automatic syntax checking)

The Flycheck developers would also like to thank the following people
and projects:

- [Bozhidar Batsov](https://github.com/bbatsov) for his valuable feedback and
  his constant support and endorsement of Flycheck from the very
  beginning. Notably he added Flycheck to his popular
  [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) project at a very early stage
  and thus brought Flycheck to many new users.
- [Magnar Sveen](https://github.com/magnars) for his
  [dash.el](https://github.com/magnars/dash.el) and
  [s.el](https://github.com/magnars/s.el) libraries, which support considerable
  parts of Flycheck internals, and greatly helped to overcome the author's
  initial aversion to Emacs Lisp.
- [Martin Grenfell](https://github.com/scrooloose) for the Vim syntax
  checking extension
  [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic), which saved
  the author's life back when he was using Vim, and served as
  inspiration for Flycheck and many of its syntax checkers.
- Pavel Kobyakov for his work on GNU Flymake, which is a great work on
  its own, despite its flaws and weaknesses
- [Steve Purcell](https://github.com/purcell) for his valuable feedback, the
  fruitful discussions and his important ideas about the shape and design of
  Flycheck, and his indispensible and dedicated work on MELPA, which drives the
  continuous distribution of Flycheck to its users.
