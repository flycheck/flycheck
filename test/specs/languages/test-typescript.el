  Could not find implementations for the following rules specified in the configuration:
      label-undefined
      no-constructor-vars

  Try upgrading TSLint and/or ensuring that you have all necessary custom rules installed.
  If TSLint was recently upgraded, you may have old rules configured which need to be cleaned up.
