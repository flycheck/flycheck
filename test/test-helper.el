;; Unit test helpers for Flycheck.

;; Test discovery and loading
;; --------------------------
;;
;; Find and load all tests.
;;
;; Test files and directories must match the
;; `flycheck-testsuite-test-file-pattern'.  Essentially this pattern matches all
;; directories and files starting with the prefix "test-".
;;
;; `flycheck-testsuite-load-tests' finds and loads all tests.

;; Resource handling
;; -----------------
;;
;; These functions can be used to load resources within a test.
;;
;; `flycheck-testsuite-resource-filename' gets the file name of resources.
;;
;; `flycheck-testsuite-with-resource-buffer' executes forms with a temporary
;; buffer using a resource file from the test suite.

;; Test helpers
;; ------------
;;
;; `flycheck-testsuite-with-hook' executes the body with a specified hook form.
;;
;; `flycheck-mode-no-check' enables Flycheck Mode in the current buffer without
;; starting a syntax check immediately.
;;
;; `flycheck-with-global-mode' enables Global Flycheck Mode while the body is
;; evaluated.
;;
;; `flycheck-testsuite-delete-temps' deletes Flycheck temporary files after the
;; body was evaluated.
;;
;; `flycheck-testsuite-with-help-buffer' kills the Help buffer after the body
;; was evaluated.
;;
;; `flycheck-testsuite-not-on-travis' signals an error if the test is run on
;; Travis CI.  Use in combination with `:expected-result' to skip tests on
;; Travis CI.

;; Test environment utilities
;; --------------------------
;;
;; `flycheck-testsuite-windows-p' determines whether the tests are running on
;; Windows.
;;
;; `flycheck-testsuite-min-emacs-version-p' determines whether Emacs has at
;; least the given version.
;;
;; `flycheck-testsuite-user-error-type' provides the type of `user-error',
;; depending on the Emacs version.

;; Test results
;; ------------
;;
;; The following functions are intended for use with as value for the
;; `:expected-result' keyword to `ert-deftest'.
;;
;; `flycheck-testsuite-fail-unless-checkers' marks a test as expected to fail if
;; the given syntax checkers are not installed.

;; Checking buffers
;; ----------------
;;
;; The following functions can be used to perform syntax checks in a test.
;;
;; `flycheck-testsuite-buffer-sync' starts a syntax check in the current buffer
;; and waits for the syntax check to complete.
;;
;; `flycheck-testsuite-wait-for-syntax-checker' waits until the syntax check in
;; the current buffer is finished.
;;
;; `flycheck-testsuite-disable-checkers' disables syntax checkers in the current
;; buffers.

;; Test predicates
;; ---------------
;;
;; `flycheck-testsuite-should-errors' tests that the current buffer has ERRORS.
;;
;; `flycheck-testsuite-should-syntax-check' tests that a syntax check results in
;; the specified errors.
;;
;; `flycheck-testsuite-ensure-clear' clear the error state of the current
;; buffer, and signals a test failure if clearing failed.
