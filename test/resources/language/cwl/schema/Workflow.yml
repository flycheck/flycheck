      # Abstract

      One way to define a workflow is: an analysis task represented by a
      directed graph describing a sequence of operations that transform an
      input data set to output. This specification defines the Common Workflow
      Language (CWL) Workflow description, a vendor-neutral standard for
      representing workflows intended to be portable across a variety of
      computing platforms.

      ## Introduction to v1.0

      This specification represents the first full release from the CWL group.
      Since draft-3, this draft introduces the following changes and additions:

        * The `inputs` and `outputs` fields have been renamed `in` and `out`.
        * Syntax simplifcations: denoted by the `map<>` syntax. Example: `in`
          contains a list of items, each with an id. Now one can specify
          a mapping of that identifier to the corresponding
          `InputParameter`.
          ```
          in:
           - id: one
             type: string
             doc: First input parameter
           - id: two
             type: int
             doc: Second input parameter
          ```
          can be
          ```
          in:
           one:
            type: string
            doc: First input parameter
           two:
            type: int
            doc: Second input parameter
          ```
        * The common field `description` has been renamed to `doc`.

      ## Purpose

      The Common Workflow Language Command Line Tool Description express
      workflows for data-intensive science, such as Bioinformatics, Chemistry,
      Physics, and Astronomy.  This specification is intended to define a data
      and execution model for Workflows that can be implemented on top of a
      variety of computing platforms, ranging from an individual workstation to
      cluster, grid, cloud, and high performance computing systems.

  docParent: "#WorkflowStep"
  doc: |
    The input of a workflow step connects an upstream parameter (from the
    workflow inputs, or the outputs of other workflows steps) with the input
    parameters of the underlying step.

    ## Input object

    A WorkflowStepInput object must contain an `id` field in the form
    `#fieldname` or `#stepname.fieldname`.  When the `id` field contains a
    period `.` the field name consists of the characters following the final
    period.  This defines a field of the workflow step input object with the
    value of the `source` parameter(s).

    ## Merging

    To merge multiple inbound data links,
    [MultipleInputFeatureRequirement](#MultipleInputFeatureRequirement) must be specified
    in the workflow or workflow step requirements.

    If the sink parameter is an array, or named in a [workflow
    scatter](#WorkflowStep) operation, there may be multiple inbound data links
    listed in the `source` field.  The values from the input links are merged
    depending on the method specified in the `linkMerge` field.  If not
    specified, the default method is "merge_nested".

    * **merge_nested**

      The input must be an array consisting of exactly one entry for each
      input link.  If "merge_nested" is specified with a single link, the value
      from the link must be wrapped in a single-item list.

    * **merge_flattened**

      1. The source and sink parameters must be compatible types, or the source
         type must be compatible with single element from the "items" type of
         the destination array parameter.
      2. Source parameters which are arrays are concatenated.
         Source parameters which are single element types are appended as
         single elements.

  fields:
    - name: id
      type: string
      jsonldPredicate: "@id"
      doc: "A unique identifier for this workflow input parameter."
    - name: default
      type: ["null", Any]
      doc: |
        The default value for this parameter if there is no `source`
        field.
      jsonldPredicate: "cwl:default"
    - name: valueFrom
      type:
        - "null"
        - "string"
        - "#Expression"
      jsonldPredicate: "cwl:valueFrom"
      doc: |
        To use valueFrom, [StepInputExpressionRequirement](#StepInputExpressionRequirement) must
        be specified in the workflow or workflow step requirements.

        If `valueFrom` is a constant string value, use this as the value for
        this input parameter.

        If `valueFrom` is a parameter reference or expression, it must be
        evaluated to yield the actual value to be assiged to the input field.

        The `self` value of in the parameter reference or expression must be
        the value of the parameter(s) specified in the `source` field, or
        null if there is no `source` field.

        The value of `inputs` in the parameter reference or expression must be
        the input object to the workflow step after assigning the `source`
        values and then scattering.  The order of evaluating `valueFrom` among
        step input parameters is undefined and the result of evaluating
        `valueFrom` on a parameter must not be visible to evaluation of
        `valueFrom` on other parameters.

  fields:
    - name: id
      type: string

      doc: |
        A unique identifier for this workflow output parameter.  This is the
        identifier to use in the `source` field of `WorkflowStepInput` to

- name: WorkflowStep
  type: record
  docParent: "#Workflow"
  doc: |
    A workflow step is an executable element of a workflow.  It specifies the
    underlying process implementation (such as `CommandLineTool` or another
    `Workflow`) in the `run` field and connects the input and output parameters
    of the underlying process to workflow parameters.

    # Scatter/gather

    To use scatter/gather,
    [ScatterFeatureRequirement](#ScatterFeatureRequirement) must be specified
    in the workflow or workflow step requirements.

    A "scatter" operation specifies that the associated workflow step or
    subworkflow should execute separately over a list of input elements.  Each
    job making up a scatter operation is independent and may be executed
    concurrently.

    The `scatter` field specifies one or more input parameters which will be
    scattered.  An input parameter may be listed more than once.  The declared
    type of each input parameter is implicitly wrapped in an array for each
    time it appears in the `scatter` field.  As a result, upstream parameters
    which are connected to scattered parameters may be arrays.

    All output parameter types are also implicitly wrapped in arrays.  Each job
    in the scatter results in an entry in the output array.

    If `scatter` declares more than one input parameter, `scatterMethod`
    describes how to decompose the input into a discrete set of jobs.

      * **dotproduct** specifies that each of the input arrays are aligned and one
          element taken from each array to construct each job.  It is an error
          if all input arrays are not the same length.

      * **nested_crossproduct** specifies the Cartesian product of the inputs,
          producing a job for every combination of the scattered inputs.  The
          output must be nested arrays for each level of scattering, in the
          order that the input arrays are listed in the `scatter` field.

      * **flat_crossproduct** specifies the Cartesian product of the inputs,
          producing a job for every combination of the scattered inputs.  The
          output arrays must be flattened to a single level, but otherwise listed in the
          order that the input arrays are listed in the `scatter` field.

    # Subworkflows

    To specify a nested workflow as part of a workflow step,
    [SubworkflowFeatureRequirement](#SubworkflowFeatureRequirement) must be
    specified in the workflow or workflow step requirements.

  fields:
    - name: id
      type: string
      jsonldPredicate: "@id"
      doc: "The unique identifier for this workflow step."

  doc: |
    A workflow describes a set of **steps** and the **dependencies** between
    those steps.  When a step produces output that will be consumed by a
    second step, the first step is a dependency of the second step.

    When there is a dependency, the workflow engine must execute the preceeding
    step and wait for it to successfully produce output before executing the
    dependent step.  If two steps are defined in the workflow graph that
    are not directly or indirectly dependent, these steps are **independent**,
    and may execute in any order or execute concurrently.  A workflow is
    complete when all steps have been executed.

    Dependencies between parameters are expressed using the `source` field on
    [workflow step input parameters](#WorkflowStepInput) and [workflow output
    parameters](#WorkflowOutputParameter).

    The `source` field expresses the dependency of one parameter on another
    such that when a value is associated with the parameter specified by
    `source`, that value is propagated to the destination parameter.  When all
    data links inbound to a given step are fufilled, the step is ready to
    execute.

    ## Workflow success and failure

    A completed step must result in one of `success`, `temporaryFailure` or
    `permanentFailure` states.  An implementation may choose to retry a step
    execution which resulted in `temporaryFailure`.  An implementation may
    choose to either continue running other steps of a workflow, or terminate
    immediately upon `permanentFailure`.

    * If any step of a workflow execution results in `permanentFailure`, then
    the workflow status is `permanentFailure`.

    * If one or more steps result in `temporaryFailure` and all other steps
    complete `success` or are not executed, then the workflow status is
    `temporaryFailure`.

    * If all workflow steps are executed and complete with `success`, then the
    workflow status is `success`.
