;;; Commentary:

;; Use with emacs -Q -l test/init.el to start a clean session with only Flycheck
;; present.
;;
;; Installs all dependencies of Flycheck to a temporary package directory, and
;; loads Flycheck.

;;; Code:

(require 'package)

(setq load-prefer-newer t)              ; Don't load outdated bytecode

(defvar temporary-package-directory
  (make-temp-file "flycheck-package-dir-" 'directory))
(add-hook 'kill-emacs-hook
          (lambda ()
            (delete-directory temporary-package-directory 'recursive)))

(setq package-user-dir temporary-package-directory
      package-check-signature nil)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("MELPA" . "http://melpa.org/packages/"))

(package-initialize)
(package-refresh-contents)
(package-install 'flycheck)             ; Install to bring dependencies in

(let* ((source-dir (locate-dominating-file load-file-name "flycheck.el")))
  (load (expand-file-name "flycheck.el" source-dir)))

(require 'flycheck)
(global-flycheck-mode)
