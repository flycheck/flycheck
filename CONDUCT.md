# The Flycheck Code of Conduct #

## Conduct ##

**Contact**: [Any moderator][moderators]

* We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
  all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity,
  religion, or similar personal characteristic.
* Please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that might
  detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
* Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
* Please do not curse or use bad words.  Foul language will not help us to build
  a great product.
* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or
  implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom
  a right answer.
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you
  want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass
  anyone. That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term "harassment" as
  including the definition in the
  [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/); if you have any
  lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read
  their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes
  people in socially marginalized groups.
* Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel
  you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community
  member, please contact one of the [Moderators][] immediately. Whether you're a
  regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe
  place for you and we've got your back.
* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing
  behaviour is not welcome.

## Moderation ##

These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct in our
communication channels, most notably in Flycheck’s Github organisation and in
Flycheck’s Gitter channels.

1. Remarks that violate the Flycheck code of conduct, including hateful,
   hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed.
2. Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of
   conduct or not, are also not allowed.
3. Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
4. If the warning is unheeded, the user will be "kicked," i.e., kicked out of
   the communication channel to cool off.
5. If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned,
   i.e., indefinitely excluded.
6. Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a
   first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
7. If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it
   up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, **in
   private**. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.
8. Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a
   moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway
   than others.

In the Flycheck community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each
other. Don't just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best
self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues,
particularly if they're off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary
fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from
the community entirely.

And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be
defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even
if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there
was something you could have communicated better — remember that it's your
responsibility to make your fellow Flycheck people comfortable. Everyone wants
to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk
about cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good
intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.
