@section Syntax checking

In @code{flycheck-mode} the buffer is automatically checked on the fly
when

@itemize
@item
the file is saved,
@item
or if new lines are inserted.
@end itemize

@noindent
You can also check the buffer manually:

@table @kbd
@item C-c ! c
@itemx M-x flycheck-buffer
@findex flycheck-buffer
Start a syntax check in the current buffer.
@end table

Each syntax check is comprised of the following steps:

@enumerate
@item
Select a suitable syntax checker.  @xref{Selection}, for more
information on how syntax checkers are selected.
@item
Copy the contents of the buffer to be checked to a temporary file.
@item
Execute the syntax checker tool(s).
@item
Parse the output of the tool, and report all errors and warnings.
@xref{Reporting}, for more information.
@item
Run hooks in @code{flycheck-after-syntax-check-hook}.
@end enumerate

@defopt flycheck-after-syntax-check-hook
This variable is a list of function to execute after a syntax check is
completed, including all chained syntax checkers.

By the time these functions are called, all errors and warnings are
already reported.  @xref{Reporting}, for more information about error
reporting.

This variable is a normal hook. @xref{Hooks, , ,elisp}.
@end defopt

@node Selection, Configuration, Syntax checking, Usage
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Syntax checker selection

By default Flycheck automatically selects a suitable syntax checker from
@code{flycheck-checkers}:

@defopt flycheck-checkers
A list of all syntax checkers to use as candidates for automatic checker
selection.

The first suitable syntax checker from this list is used to check a
buffer.  A syntax checker is suitable, if
@itemize
@item
it may be used for the current major mode,
@item
it's predicate matches,
@item
and if the syntax checking tool exists.
@end itemize

A syntax checker contained in this list is said to be @dfn{registered}.

@xref{Syntax checkers}, for a list of available checkers.
@end defopt

If no suitable syntax checker is found the syntax check is
@emph{silently} omitted.  @emph{No} error is signaled, and only a
specific indicator informs about the omitted syntax check.  @xref{Mode
line}.

You can manually select a specific syntax checker for the current
buffer, too:

@table @kbd
@item C-c ! s
@itemx M-x flycheck-select-checker
@findex flycheck-select-checker
Prompt for a checker.  If no syntax checker is entered deselect the
current syntax checker, and re-enable automatic selection again.  With
prefix arg, re-enable automatic selection without prompting.

Syntax checker do @emph{not} need to be registered to be manually
selected with this command.
@end table

@noindent
@code{flycheck-select-checker} sets @code{flycheck-checker}:

@defvar flycheck-checker
Syntax checker to use for the current buffer.

The variable is buffer local, and safe as file local variable for
registered checkers.

If unset, automatically select a suitable syntax checker.

If set, only use this syntax checker.  Automatic selection is
@emph{disabled}.  If the syntax checker is unusable, signal an error.
@end defvar

@noindent
You may directly set this variable, e.g. via file local variables.  For
instance, you can use the following file local variable within a Python
source file to always check this file with @command{pylint}:

@example
# Local Variables:
# flycheck-checker: python-pylint
# End:
@end example

@noindent
@xref{Specifying File Variables, , ,emacs}, for more information about
file variables.

Each syntax checker provides documentation with information about the
executable the syntax checker uses, in which buffers it will be used for
syntax checks, and whether it can be configured.  @xref{Configuration},
for more information about syntax checker configuration.

@table @kbd
@item C-c ! ?
@itemx M-x flycheck-describe-checker
@findex flycheck-describe-checker
Show the documentation of a syntax checker.
@end table

@section Syntax checker configuration

Some syntax checkers can be configured via options.  The following
options are provided by Flycheck (use @kbd{C-h v} or @kbd{M-x
describe-variable} on the variable name for detailed help):

@defopt flycheck-cpplint-verbosity
The verbosity level the @code{c++-cpplint} syntax checker shall use.
@end defopt

@defopt flycheck-cpplint-category-filter
A comma-separated list of category-filters to pass to the
@code{c++-cpplint} syntax checker.
@end defopt

@defopt flycheck-flake8-maximum-complexity
The maximum McCabe complexity the @code{python-flake8} syntax checker
allows without reporting a warning.
@end defopt

@defopt flycheck-flake8-maximum-line-length
The maximum length of a line in characters the @code{python-flake8}
syntax checker allows without reporting an error.
@end defopt

@defopt flycheck-phpcs-standard
The coding standard the syntax checker @code{php-phpcs} shall use.
@end defopt

Some syntax checkers also read configuration files denoted by associated
@dfn{configuration file variables}.  The following configuration files
are provided by Flycheck:

@defopt flycheck-chktexrc
The configuration file for the @code{tex-chktex} syntax checker.
@end defopt

@defopt flycheck-coffeelintrc
The configuration file for the @code{coffee-coffeelint} syntax checker.
@end defopt

@defopt flycheck-flake8rc
The configuration file for the @code{python-flake8} syntax checker.
@end defopt

@defopt flycheck-jshintrc
The configuration file for the @code{javascript-jshint} syntax checker.
@end defopt

@defopt flycheck-rubocoprc
The configuration file for the @code{ruby-rubocup} syntax checker.
@end defopt

@defopt flycheck-tidyrc
The configuration file for the @code{html-tidy} syntax checker.
@end defopt

All configuration file variables are interpreted according to the
following rules:

If the variable contains a plain file name @emph{without} any slash,
e.g. @file{.jshintrc}, this file is searched

@enumerate
@item
in the buffer's directory,
@item
any ancestors thereof,
@item
and in the @env{HOME} directory eventually.
@end enumerate

@noindent
If the buffer has no @code{buffer-file-name}, only the @env{HOME}
directory is searched.

If the variable contains a @emph{path with} a slash,
e.g. @file{./.jshintrc} or @file{~/.jshintrc}, the path is expanded
against the buffer's directory using @code{expand-file-name}.

Customize these variables using @kbd{M-x customize-group RET
flycheck-config-files}.  Use @code{flycheck-describe-checker} to find
out whether a syntax checker has a configuration file.

You may also use these variables as file-local variables.  For instance,
the following checks the Javascript file always with @file{.jshintrc}
from the parent directory:

@example
// Local variables:
// flycheck-jshintrc: "../.jshintrc"
// End:
@end example

Some syntax checkers have options that cannot be changed in
configuration files.  These options can be changed by various variables.
Customize these with @kbd{M-x customize-group RET flycheck-options}.

@section Error reporting

Errors and warnings from a syntax checker are
@itemize
@item
reported in the mode line or in a popup buffer, depending on the length
of the error messages,
@item
indicated by fringe icons,
@item
and highlighted in the buffer with @code{flycheck-error-face} and
@code{flycheck-warning-face} respectively, according to
@code{flycheck-highlighting-mode}
@end itemize

@defopt flycheck-error-face
@defoptx flycheck-warning-face
The faces to use to highlight errors and warnings respectively.

Note that the default faces provided by GNU Emacs are ill-suited to
highlight errors because these are relatively pale and do not specify a
background color or underline.  Hence highlights are easily overlook and
even @b{invisible} for white space.

For best error highlighting customize these faces, or choose a color
theme that has reasonable Flycheck faces, for instance the excellent
@url{https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs,Solarized theme}.
@end defopt

@defopt flycheck-highlighting-mode
This variable determines how to highlight errors:

If set to @code{columns} try to highlight errors as exactly as possible.
If an error provides information about a specific column, only this
column is highlighted.  This retains as much information as possible
from the syntax checker, but a single column highlight may be easily
overlooked.  This mode is the default.

If set to @code{lines} the whole line on which the error occurred is
highlighted, regardless of whether the error is actually specific to a
column.  Column information is hence ignored.

If set to @code{nil} highlighting is completely disabled.  Errors will
only be reported via fringe icons and error message popups.

Note that this variable does @emph{not} affect error @emph{navigation}.
@code{next-error} and @code{previous-error} always jump to the error
column, regardless of the highlighting mode.
@end defopt

To view an error message, either hover the mouse of the highlighted
error, or move the point to the highlighted error and wait for a short
moment to see the error message in the echo area.

@table @kbd
@item C-c ! C
@itemx M-x flycheck-clear
@findex flycheck-clear
Clear all Flycheck errors and warnings in the current buffer.
@end table

@section Error navigation

Flycheck supports the standard error navigation commands of Emacs.  If
@b{no} compilation buffer (including those from @kbd{M-x compile},
@kbd{M-x grep}, @kbd{M-x occur}, etc.) is visible, @kbd{M-g n}
(@code{next-error}) and @kbd{M-g p} (@code{previous-error}) will
navigate between Flycheck warnings and errors in the current buffer.
@xref{Compilation Mode, , ,emacs}, for more information about these
commands.

Visible compilation buffers take precedence over Flycheck navigation.
If such a buffer is visible, @kbd{M-g n} and @kbd{M-g p} will ignore
Flycheck errors and warnings, and navigate errors (or generally results)
reported by the compilation buffer instead.

To address this issue, Flycheck provides independent error navigation
commands:

@table @kbd
@item C-c ! n
@itemx M-x flycheck-next-error
@findex flycheck-next-error
Jump to the next Flycheck error.

With prefix argument, jump forwards by as many errors as specified by
the prefix argument, e.g. @kbd{M-3 C-c ! n} will move to the 3rd error
from the current point.

@item C-c ! p
@itemx M-x flycheck-previous-error
@findex flycheck-previous-error
Jump to the previous Flycheck error.

With prefix argument, jump backwards by as many errors as specified by
the prefix argument, e.g. @kbd{M-3 C-c ! p} will move to the 3rd
previous error from the current point.

@item M-x flycheck-first-error
Jump to the first Flycheck error.

With prefix argument, jump forwards to by as many errors as specified by
the prefix argument, e.g. @kbd{M-3 M-x flycheck-first-error} moves to
the 3rd error from the beginning of the buffer.

@end table

Error navigation jumps to the exact error column, or to the first
non-whitespace character of a line if the error is not specific to a
column.

@section Mode line

Flycheck indicates its state in the mode line:

@table @samp
@item FlyC
There are no errors in the current buffer.
@item FlyC*
A syntax check is being performed currently.
@item FlyC:3/4
There are three errors and four warnings in the current buffer.
@item FlyC-
Automatic syntax checker selection did not find a suitable syntax
checker.  @xref{Selection}, for more information.
@item FlyC!
The syntax check failed.  Inspect the @code{*Messages*} buffer for
details.
@item FlyC?
The syntax check had a dubious result.  The definition of the syntax
checker may be flawed.  Inspect the @code{*Messages*} buffer for
details.  This indicator should never be displayed for built-in syntax
checkers.  If it is, please report this issue to the Flycheck
developers.  @xref{Reporting issues}.
