1 Introduction
**************

Flycheck provides on-the-fly syntax checking for GNU Emacs 24.
Essentially it is "Flymake done right" with

   * ready-to-use syntax checkers for a bunch of languages

   * simple declarative checker definitions,

   * checkers based on major modes,

   * and a clean, concise and understandable implementation with decent
     test coverage.

File: flycheck.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: Activation,  Prev: Features,  Up: Introduction

1.2 Installation
================

Install the ELPA package from MELPA (http://melpa.milkbox.net) or
Marmalade (http://marmalade-repo.org/) using `M-x package-install RET
flycheck'.  The former is the _recommended_ repository.

   Neither of these repositories is included in GNU Emacs by default.
You need to enable these repositories explicitly.  For instance, to add
the MELPA repository, add the following code to `init.el':

     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
     (package-initialize)

   Flycheck is written and tested against GNU Emacs 24.2 and newer.  It
should work on GNU Emacs 24.1, too.  Earlier releases of GNU Emacs,
especially GNU Emacs 23 and before, and other flavors of Emacs (e.g.
XEmacs, Aquamacs, etc.) are not supported.  Flycheck may or may not
work, the latter being more likely.

   Most checkers depend on external tools to perform the actual syntax
checking.  Use `flycheck-describe-checker' to get help about a syntax
checker and its dependencies.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Activation,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Introduction

1.3 Activation
==============

Enable `flycheck-mode' in your `init.el' file:

     (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode)
     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode)

Alternatively, use `M-x flycheck-mode' to manually enable Flycheck.

2.1 Syntax checking
===================

In `flycheck-mode' the buffer is automatically checked on the fly when

   * the file is saved,

   * or if new lines are inserted.

You can also check the buffer manually:

`C-c ! c'
`M-x flycheck-buffer'
     Start a syntax check in the current buffer.

   Each syntax check is comprised of the following steps:

  1. Select a suitable syntax checker.  *Note Selection::, for more
     information on how syntax checkers are selected.

  2. Copy the contents of the buffer to be checked to a temporary file.

  3. Execute the syntax checker tool(s).

  4. Parse the output of the tool, and report all errors and warnings.
     *Note Reporting::, for more information.

  5. Run hooks in `flycheck-after-syntax-check-hook'.

 -- User Option: flycheck-after-syntax-check-hook
     This variable is a list of function to execute after a syntax
     check is completed, including all chained syntax checkers.

     By the time these functions are called, all errors and warnings are
     already reported.  *Note Reporting::, for more information about
     error reporting.

     This variable is a normal hook. *Note Hooks: (elisp)Hooks.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Selection,  Next: Configuration,  Prev: Syntax checking,  Up: Usage

2.2 Syntax checker selection
============================

By default Flycheck automatically selects a suitable syntax checker from
`flycheck-checkers':

 -- User Option: flycheck-checkers
     A list of all syntax checkers to use as candidates for automatic
     checker selection.

     The first suitable syntax checker from this list is used to check a
     buffer.  A syntax checker is suitable, if
        * it may be used for the current major mode,

        * it's predicate matches,

        * and if the syntax checking tool exists.

     A syntax checker contained in this list is said to be "registered".

     *Note Syntax checkers::, for a list of available checkers.

   If no suitable syntax checker is found the syntax check is
_silently_ omitted.  _No_ error is signaled, and only a specific
indicator informs about the omitted syntax check.  *Note Mode line::.

   You can manually select a specific syntax checker for the current
buffer, too:

`C-c ! s'
`M-x flycheck-select-checker'
     Prompt for a checker.  If no syntax checker is entered deselect the
     current syntax checker, and re-enable automatic selection again.
     With prefix arg, re-enable automatic selection without prompting.

     Syntax checker do _not_ need to be registered to be manually
     selected with this command.

`flycheck-select-checker' sets `flycheck-checker':

 -- Variable: flycheck-checker
     Syntax checker to use for the current buffer.

     The variable is buffer local, and safe as file local variable for
     registered checkers.

     If unset, automatically select a suitable syntax checker.

     If set, only use this syntax checker.  Automatic selection is
     _disabled_.  If the syntax checker is unusable, signal an error.

You may directly set this variable, e.g. via file local variables.  For
instance, you can use the following file local variable within a Python
source file to always check this file with `pylint':

     # Local Variables:
     # flycheck-checker: python-pylint
     # End:

*Note Specifying File Variables: (emacs)Specifying File Variables, for
more information about file variables.

   Each syntax checker provides documentation with information about the
executable the syntax checker uses, in which buffers it will be used for
syntax checks, and whether it can be configured.  *Note Configuration::,
for more information about syntax checker configuration.

`C-c ! ?'
`M-x flycheck-describe-checker'
     Show the documentation of a syntax checker.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Configuration,  Next: Reporting,  Prev: Selection,  Up: Usage

2.3 Syntax checker configuration
================================

Some syntax checkers read configuration files.  These checkers have an
associated variable providing the name of the configuration file, for
instance `flycheck-jshintrc' for the `javascript-jshint' syntax
checker.  These variables obey the following rules:

   If the variable contains a plain file name _without_ any slash, e.g.
`.jshintrc', this file is searched

  1. in the buffer's directory,

  2. any ancestors thereof,

  3. and in the `HOME' directory eventually.

If the buffer has no `buffer-file-name', only the `HOME' directory is
searched.

   If the variable contains a _path with_ a slash, e.g. `./.jshintrc'
or `~/.jshintrc', the path is expanded against the buffer's directory
using `expand-file-name'.

   Customize these variables using `M-x customize-group RET
flycheck-config-files'.  Use `flycheck-describe-checker' to find out
whether a syntax checker has a configuration file.

   You may also use these variables as file-local variables.  For
instance, the following checks the Javascript file always with
`.jshintrc' from the parent directory:

     // Local variables:
     // flycheck-jshintrc: "../.jshintrc"
     // End:


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Reporting,  Next: Navigation,  Prev: Configuration,  Up: Usage

2.4 Error reporting
===================

Errors and warnings from a syntax checker are
   * reported in the mode line,

   * indicated by fringe icons,

   * and highlighted in the buffer with `flycheck-error-face' and
     `flycheck-warning-face' respectively, according to
     `flycheck-highlighting-mode'

 -- User Option: flycheck-error-face
 -- User Option: flycheck-warning-face
     The faces to use to highlight errors and warnings respectively.

     Note that the default faces provided by GNU Emacs are ill-suited to
     highlight errors because these are relatively pale and do not
     specify a background color or underline.  Hence highlights are
     easily overlook and even invisible for white space.

     For best error highlighting customize these faces, or choose a
     color theme that has reasonable Flycheck faces, for instance the
     excellent Solarized theme
     (https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs).

 -- User Option: flycheck-highlighting-mode
     This variable determines how to highlight errors:

     If set to `columns' try to highlight errors as exactly as possible.
     If an error provides information about a specific column, only this
     column is highlighted.  This retains as much information as
     possible from the syntax checker, but a single column highlight
     may be easily overlooked.  This mode is the default.

     If set to `lines' the whole line on which the error occurred is
     highlighted, regardless of whether the error is actually specific
     to a column.  Column information is hence ignored.

     If set to `nil' highlighting is completely disabled.  Errors will
     only be reported via fringe icons and in the mode line.

     Note that this variable does _not_ affect error _navigation_.
     `next-error' and `previous-error' always jump to the error column,
     regardless of the highlighting mode.

   To view an error message, either hover the mouse of the highlighted
error, or move the point to the highlighted error and wait for a short
moment to see the error message in the echo area.

`C-c ! C'
`M-x flycheck-clear'
     Clear all Flycheck errors and warnings in the current buffer.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Navigation,  Next: Mode line,  Prev: Reporting,  Up: Usage

2.5 Error navigation
====================

Use `M-g n' (`next-error') and `M-g p' (`previous-error') to navigate
between Flycheck warnings and errors in the current buffer.  *Note
Compilation Mode: (emacs)Compilation Mode, for more information about
these commands.

   Note that as Flycheck integrates itself into the standard error
navigation provided by Compilation Mode, _visible_ compilation buffers
take preference over buffers with Flycheck errors.  This includes
buffers from `M-x compile', `M-x grep' and generally all buffers with
Compilation Mode or Compilation Minor Mode.

   If such a buffer is visible, `M-g n' and `M-g p' will ignore
Flycheck errors and warnings, and navigate errors (or generally results)
reported by that buffer instead.   To navigation Flycheck errors again,
hide the buffer, e.g. with `C-x 1'.

   Error navigation jumps to the error column, or to the first
non-whitespace character of a line if the error is not specific to a
column.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Mode line,  Prev: Navigation,  Up: Usage

2.6 Mode line
=============

Flycheck indicates its state in the mode line:

`FlyC'
     There are no errors in the current buffer.

`FlyC*'
     A syntax check is being performed currently.

`FlyC:3/4'
     There are three errors and four warnings in the current buffer.

`FlyC-'
     Automatic syntax checker selection did not find a suitable syntax
     checker.  *Note Selection::, for more information.

`FlyC!'
     The syntax check failed.  Inspect the `*Messages*' buffer for
     details.

`FlyC?'
     The syntax check had a dubious result.  The definition of the
     syntax checker may be flawed.  Inspect the `*Messages*' buffer for
     details.  This indicator should never be displayed for built-in
     syntax checkers.  If it is, please report this issue to the
     Flycheck developers.  *Note Reporting issues::.

3.1 Declaration of syntax checkers
==================================

Checkers are declared with `flycheck-declare-checker':

 -- Macro: flycheck-declare-checker symbol docstring &rest properties
     Declare SYMBOL as new syntax checker with PROPERTIES.

     DOCSTRING provides documentation for the syntax checker.

     The PROPERTIES specify the new syntax checker:

    `:command '(EXECUTABLE ARGUMENTS...)'
          A list providing the command to execute.  The command
          consists of an EXECUTABLE specified as string in the `car',
          and the ARGUMENTS for this executable in the `cdr'.  *Note
          List elements: (elisp)List elements, for more information
          about the elements of a list.

          The EXECUTABLE is checked for existence with
          `executable-find' before executing the syntax checker.

          In ARGUMENTS, various special symbols are substituted before
          executing the syntax checker:

         `source'
         `source-inplace'
               These symbols are substituted with the file to check.
               This file is a temporary file with the contents of the
               buffer.  With `source' the copy is created in the
               temporary directory of the system.  This is
               _recommended_.

               With `source-inplace' the temporary files is created in
               the same directory as the buffer's file.  Use this, if
               the syntax check needs other files from the source
               directory.  If the buffer has no `buffer-file-name',
               `source-inplace' is the same as `source'.

         `source-original'
               This symbol is substituted with `buffer-file-name', or
               an empty string, if the buffer has no file name.  Note
               that if the buffer is modified, the content of the file
               is not up to date with the actual content of the buffer.
               Hence do not use this as primary input to a syntax
               checker!

               See the declaration of the `emacs-lisp-checkdoc' syntax
               checker for an application of this symbol.

         `(config-file OPTION VARIABLE)'
               This cell is substituted with a configuration file for
               the syntax checker.  OPTION is a string containing the
               option that specifies a configuration file to the syntax
               checker tool.

               VARIABLE is a symbol referring to a variable from which
               to obtain the name or path of the configuration file.
               *Note Configuration::, for more information about syntax
               checker configuration.  Define this variable with
               `flycheck-def-config-file-var'.

               If the configuration file is found according to the
               rules documented in *note Configuration::, the symbol is
               substituted with the OPTION and the absolute path to the
               configuration file as string.  Otherwise the symbol is
               simply dropped from the arguments of the syntax checker.

         `(eval FORM)'
               This cell is substituted with a result of FORM
               evaluation. No substitutions are performed in FORM
               before it is evaluated.

          This property is mandatory.

    `:error-parser 'PARSER'
          An error parser to use for parsing the output of the syntax
          checker.

          The PARSER is a function symbol.  *Note Error parsers::, for
          more information about error parsers, including a list of
          built-in error parsers.

          Using a error parser is preferred if a syntax checker
          provides a structured output format like XML or JSON.  If
          possible, re-use one of the built-in error parsers listed in
          *note Error parsers::

          May not be specified together with `:error-patterns'.

    `:error-patterns '((REGEXP LEVEL)...)'
          A list of one or more error patterns to parse the output of
          `:command'.

          The REGEXP is a regular expression matching a single error or
          warning.  The LEVEL is either `error' or `warning' and
          classifies the severity of the matched error message.

          Do not use error patterns if you can use an error parser.

          The REGEXP may provide the following match groups:

         _Group 1_
               The file name.

         _Group 2_
               The line number.

         _Group 3_
               The column number.

         _Group 4_
               The error text.

          Each of these groups is optional, however error messages
          without line numbers will be ignored.  Use explicitly
          numbered groups to make sure that the group numbering is
          correct.  *Note Regexp Backslash: (elisp)Regexp Backslash,
          for more information about regular expression groups.

          The patterns are applied in the order of declaration to the
          whole output of the syntax checker.  Output already matched
          by a pattern will not be matched by subsequent patterns.  In
          other words, the first pattern wins.

          May not be specified together with `:error-parser'.

    `:modes 'MAJOR-MODE'
    `:modes '(MAJOR-MODE...)'
          A single MAJOR-MODE, or a list thereof.

          MAJOR-MODE is a symbol referring to a major mode.  If given
          the syntax checker will only be used in buffers with any of
          the given major modes.

    `:predicate FORM'
          A predicate that determines whether the syntax checker may be
          used.

          FORM is a quoted Emacs Lisp form.  It is evaluated before each
          syntax check to determine whether the syntax checker may be
          used for the current buffer.  If FORM evaluates to nil, the
          syntax checker is not used.

          If :MODES is given, FORM is only evaluated if the major mode
          matches.  Otherwise the syntax checker is not used.

    `:next-checker '(ITEM...)'
          A list of syntax checker to run after this syntax checker.

          Each ITEM is either a single syntax checker symbol, or a cons
          cell `(PREDICATE . CHECKER)'.  Each ITEM is tried on the
          order of declaration.

          If the ITEM is a syntax checker symbol, determine whether it
          is usable and registered (i.e. contained in
          `flycheck-checkers').  If so start a new syntax check with
          that syntax checker, and merged its results with the results
          of this syntax checker.  If not, try the next ITEM.

          If ITEM is a cons cell, PREDICATE specifies whether to run
          the CHECKER depending on the results of this syntax checker:

         `no-errors'
               The CHECKER is only used if this syntax checker resulted
               in no errors at all.

         `warnings-only'
               The CHECKER is only used if this syntax checker did not
               result in error messages of severity `error'.

          If the predicate matches, and CHECKER is usable and
          registered, start a new syntax checker with CHECKER and
          merged its results with the results of this syntax checker.
          If not, try the next ITEM.

          If there is no further ITEM, finish the syntax check.

     At least on of `:modes' and `:predicate' must be present.  If both
     are present, both must match for the syntax checker to be used.

     Either `:error-patterns' or `:error-parser' must be present.  If
     both are present, an error is signaled.

   A syntax checker declared with `flycheck-declare-checker' is already
suitable for manual checker selection with `flycheck-select-checker'.
For automatic selection the syntax checker must be registered by adding
it to `flycheck-checkers'.  *Note Selection::.

 -- Macro: flycheck-def-config-file-var SYMBOL CHECKER &optional
          FILENAME
     Define SYMBOL as configuration file variable for a syntax CHECKER,
     with a default value of FILENAME.

     SYMBOL is declared as customizable variable using `defcustom', to
     provide a configuration file for the given syntax CHECKER.  The
     variable has the customization type `string', and gets a

     FILENAME is used as initial value for the variable.  If omitted,
     the initial value is nil.

3.2 Error parsers
=================

Syntax checkers may use more sophisticated error parsing by using the
`:error-parser' property.  *Note Declaration::.

   Flycheck provides the following error parsers for use by syntax
checkers:

`flycheck-parse-checkstyle'
     Parse XML output similar to Checkstyle
     (http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/).

   You may also define your own error parsers.  An error parser is a
function that takes three arguments:

OUTPUT
     The complete output of the syntax checker as string.

CHECKER
     A symbol denoting the executed syntax checker.

BUFFER
     A buffer object referring to the buffer that was syntax-checked.

   The function shall return a list of Flycheck errors.  *Note Error
API::, for more information about Flycheck errors.

   Flycheck provides some utility functions to implement error parsers.

File: flycheck.info,  Node: Simple example,  Next: Predicate example,  Prev: Examples,  Up: Examples

3.3.1 Basic syntax checkers
---------------------------

As explained in the previous chapter *note Extending:: a syntax checker
is declared with `flycheck-declare-checker'.

   We will use this function to declare a syntax checker using the
CodeSniffer utility for the PHP programming language:

     (flycheck-declare-checker php-phpcs
       "A PHP syntax checker using PHP_CodeSniffer.

     See URL `http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer/'."
       :command '("phpcs" "--report=checkstyle" source)
       :error-parser 'flycheck-parse-checkstyle
       :modes '(php-mode php+-mode))

   First we specify the `:command' to execute.  The first element of
the command list is the name of the executable, `phpcs' in our case.
This command is checked for existence with `executable-find' before
using this syntax checker.  If the command does not exist, the syntax
checker is _not_ used.

   The executable is following by the arguments, in this case some
options and the symbol `source'.  This symbol is replaced with the file
to check.  This file is a temporary file created in the system temporary
directory and containing the contents of the buffer to check.

   Next we specify how to parse the output of the syntax checker.  PHP
CodeSniffer provides an option to output errors in an XML format similar
to the Java tool Checkstyle, so we use the built-in _error parser_
`flycheck-parse-checkstyle' to parse the output.

   Eventually we enable the syntax checker in PHP editing modes.

   If the syntax checker does not provide any sort of structured output
format, we have to parse the error messages from the textual output.  To
do so, we can use _error patterns_, like in the Pylint syntax checker
for the Python programming language:

     (flycheck-declare-checker python-pylint
       "A Python syntax and style checker using the pylint utility.

     See URL `http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint'."
       :command '("epylint" source-inplace)
       :error-patterns
       '(("^\\(?1:.*\\):\\(?2:[0-9]+\\): Warning (W.*): \\(?4:.*\\)$" warning)
         ("^\\(?1:.*\\):\\(?2:[0-9]+\\): Error (E.*): \\(?4:.*\\)$" error)
         ("^\\(?1:.*\\):\\(?2:[0-9]+\\): \\[F\\] \\(?4:.*\\)$" error))
       :modes 'python-mode)

   Again, there is a `:command', however we use the `source-inplace'
symbol this time.  This symbol causes the temporary file to be created
in the same directory as the original file, making information from the
source code tree available to the syntax checker.  In case of Pylint,
these are the Python packages from the source code tree.

   Next we give the list of _error patterns_ to parse errors.  These
patterns extract the error location and the error message from the
output of `epylint'.  An error pattern is a list containing a regular
expression with match groups to extract the error information, and an
error level (either `warning' or `error').

   Eventually we enable the syntax checker in `python-mode'.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Predicate example,  Next: Configuration example,  Prev: Simple example,  Up: Examples

3.3.2 Syntax checkers with predicates
-------------------------------------

In the previous examples the syntax checkers were specific to certain
major modes.  However, this is not always the case.  For instance, GNU
Emacs provides a single mode only for shell scripting in various Shell
languages.  A syntax checker for a specific shell must check whether the
edited shell script is written for the right shell:

     (flycheck-declare-checker zsh
       "A Zsh syntax checker using the zsh executable.

     See URL `http://www.zsh.org/'."
       :command '("zsh" "-n" "-d" "-f" source)
       :error-patterns '(("^\\(?1:.*\\):\\(?2:[0-9]+\\): \\(?4:.*\\)$" error))
       :modes 'sh-mode
       :predicate '(eq sh-shell 'zsh))

   This syntax checker for the Zsh shell is enabled in `sh-mode' as
specified by `:modes', however it specifies an additional `:predicate'
to determine whether the right shell is in use.  Hence this syntax
checker is only used if a Zsh shell scripting is being edited in
`sh-mode', but not if a Bash or POSIX Shell script is being edited.

   A syntax checker may even go as far as not having `:modes' at all.
For instance, there is no special JSON mode, but syntax checking JSON is
still desirable.  Hence a JSON syntax checker may use the `:predicate'
to check the file extension:

     (flycheck-declare-checker json-jsonlint
       "A JSON syntax and style checker using jsonlint.

     See URL `https://github.com/zaach/jsonlint'."
       :command '("jsonlint" "-c" "-q" source)
       :error-patterns
       '(("^\\(?1:.+\\)\: line \\(?2:[0-9]+\\), col \\(?3:[0-9]+\\), \\(?4:.+\\)$"
          error))
       :predicate '(and buffer-file-name
                        (string= "json" (file-name-extension buffer-file-name)))))

   This syntax checker is now used whenever a file ends with .json,
regardless of the major mode.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Configuration example,  Next: Chaining example,  Prev: Predicate example,  Up: Examples

3.3.3 Configuration files for syntax checkers
---------------------------------------------

Some syntax checkers can be configured using configuration files given
by an option.  Flycheck provides built-in support to handle such
configuration files:

     (flycheck-def-config-file-var flycheck-jshintrc javascript-jshint ".jshintrc")

     (flycheck-declare-checker javascript-jshint
       "A JavaScript syntax and style checker using jshint.

     See URL `http://www.jshint.com'."
       :command '("jshint" "--checkstyle-reporter"
                  (config-file "--config" flycheck-jshintrc) source)
       :error-parser 'flycheck-parse-checkstyle
       :modes '(js-mode js2-mode js3-mode))

   As you can see, we declare a syntax checker for Javascript, using the
`jshint' utility.  This utility accepts a configuration file via the
`--config' option.

   To use a configuration file with jshint, we first declare the
variable `flycheck-jshintrc' that provides the name of the file, as
explained in *note Configuration::.

   In the `:command' we use a `config-file' element to pass the
configuration file to the syntax checker.  If the configuration file is
found, its path will be passed to the syntax checker, using the option
specified after the `config-file' symbol.  Otherwise the whole element
is simply omitted from the command line.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Chaining example,  Prev: Configuration example,  Up: Examples

3.3.4 Chaining syntax checkers
------------------------------

For many languages, more than a single syntax checker is applicable.
For instance, Emacs Lisp can be checked for syntactic corrections with
the byte code compiler, and for adherence to the Emacs Lisp
documentation style using Checkdoc.  PHP, too, can be syntax checked
with the PHP parser, and verified against coding styles using PHP
CodeSniffer.

   To support such cases, syntax checkers can be "chained" using the
`:next-checkers'.  The standard PHP syntax checker uses this to run PHP
CodeSniffer if there are no syntax errors:

     (flycheck-declare-checker php
       "A PHP syntax checker using the PHP command line.

     See URL `http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.php'."
       :command '("php" "-l" "-d" "error_reporting=E_ALL" "-d" "display_errors=1"
                  "-d" "log_errors=0" source)
       :error-patterns
       '(("\\(?:Parse\\|Fatal\\|syntax\\) error[:,] \\(?4:.*\\) in \\(?1:.*\\) on line \\(?2:[0-9]+\\)"
         error))
       :modes '(php-mode php+-mode)
       :next-checkers '((warnings-only . php-phpcs)))

   Now PHP CodeSniffer will check the coding style, whenever a PHP
syntax check did not result in any errors, if PHP CodeSniffer syntax
checker is usable _and_ registered.

4 Flycheck API
**************

This chapter provides a brief overview over the Flycheck API.

   You may use this API to extend Flycheck, e.g. by implementing new
error parsers or more in-depth error analysis.  You will also find this
API helpful if you want to develop Flycheck itself.

   As said this chapter merely provides an overview over the Flycheck
API.  The documentation is therefore rather brief.  For a definite
reference on a function or variable, consult its docstring via
`describe-function' and `describe-variable' respectively.

* Menu:

* Error API::                   How to create and inspect Flycheck errors
* Error parser API::            Utilities for implementing error parsers


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Error API,  Next: Error parser API,  Prev: API,  Up: API

4.1 Error API
=============

Flycheck errors are represented by the structure `flycheck-error'.
*Note Structures: (cl)Structures, for information about CL structures.

   This structure has the following attributes, each of which may be
nil:

`buffer'
     The buffer object referring to the buffer this error belongs to.

     Note that you do not need to set this attribute when creating
     errors in an error parser.  Flycheck automatically keeps track of
     the buffer itself.

`filename'
     A string containing the filename the error refers to.

`line'
     An integer providing the line the error refers to.

`column'
     An integer providing the column the error refers to.

     If this attribute is nil, Flycheck will assume the error to refer
     to the whole line.

`message'
     The human-readable error message as string.

`level'
     The severity of the error message, as either `error' or `warning'.

   The structure has only a single constructor:

 -- Function: flycheck-error-new attributes
     Create a new Flycheck error with the given ATTRIBUTES.

     ATTRIBUTES are given as keyword arguments.

   The following functions are provided to work with errors:

 -- Function: flycheck-error-with-buffer err &optional forms
     Evaluate FORMS with the current buffer set to the buffer of ERR.
     If this buffer is not live, FORMS are not evaluated.

 -- Function: flycheck-error-region err &optional ignore-column
     Get the buffer region referred to by ERR.

     If IGNORE-COLUMN is non-nil, ignore the column attribute of ERR
     when determining the region.

     Return the region as cons cell `(BEG . END)'.

 -- Function: flycheck-error-pos err
     Get the buffer position referred to by ERR.

     This is the position that error navigation would jump to when
     navigating to this error.

   The following functions and variables may be used to analyze the
errors of a syntax check.

 -- Variable: flycheck-current-errors
     This buffer-local variable stores the errors of the last syntax
     check, sorted by line and column number.

 -- Function: flycheck-count-errors errors
     Count the number of errors and warnings in ERRORS.

     Return a cons cell `(NO-ERRORS . NO-WARNINGS)'.

 -- Function: flycheck-has-errors-p errors &optional level
     Determine if there are any ERRORS with the given LEVEL.

     If LEVEL is omitted, determine whether ERRORS is not nil.
     Otherwise determine whether there are any errors whose level is
     equal to the given LEVEL.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
