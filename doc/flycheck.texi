@chapter Introduction


Flycheck is a modern on-the-fly syntax checking extension for GNU Emacs 24,
intended as replacement for the older Flymake extension which is part of GNU
Emacs.

It uses various syntax checking and linting tools to automatically check the
contents of buffers while you type, and reports warnings and errors directly in
the buffer, or in an optional error list.

@chapter Flycheck versus Flymake


This article provides information about Flycheck compares to the @emph{built-in}
Flymake mode.  It does not consider the improved Flymake fork@footnote{https://github.com/illusori/emacs-flymake} or third-party
extensions such as flymake-easy@footnote{https://github.com/purcell/flymake-easy} or flymake-cursor@footnote{http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/flymake-cursor.el}, but references them at
appropriate places.

We aim for this comparison to be neutral and complete, but do not provide any
guarantee for completeness or correctness of the following information.
Moreover, we consider Flycheck superior to Flymake in all aspects.  As such, you
may find this page biased towards Flycheck.  Please excuse this as well as any
factual mistake or lack of information.  Please suggest improvements.

@subsection Relation to Emacs


@strong{Flymake} is part of GNU Emacs since GNU Emacs 22.  As such, contributions to
Flymake are subject to the FSF policies on GNU projects.  Most notably,
contributors are required to assign their copyright to the FSF by signing a
contributor agreement.

@strong{Flycheck} is not part of GNU Emacs, and is @strong{unlikely to ever be}.  However,
it is free software as well, and publicly developed on the well-known code
hosting platform Github@footnote{https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck}.  Contributing to Flycheck does not require a copyright
assignments.

@node Enabling syntax checking,Syntax checkers,Relation to Emacs,Detailed review
@anchor{guide/flycheck-versus-flymake enabling-syntax-checking}@anchor{14}
@subsection Enabling syntax checking


@strong{Flymake} is not enabled automatically for supported languages.  It must be be
enabled for each mode individually and @strong{carefully}, because it does not deal
well with unavailable syntax checker tools.  In a GUI frame, it signals errors
in GUI dialogs.  In a TTY frame, it does not signal any error at all, but
instead silently hangs.  The same occurs, when a syntax checker tool becomes
unavailable after Flymake Mode is enabled, for instance, because the underlying
tool was uninstalled.


The third-party library flymake-easy@footnote{https://github.com/purcell/flymake-easy} provides an alternate way to enable
Flymake Mode, which gracefully handles unavailable syntax checkers.  It does not
check whether the tool still exists before a syntax check, though, and thus does
still exposes above behavior, when a tool becomes unavailable after the mode was
enabled.

@strong{Flycheck} provides a global mode (see @ref{15,,global-flycheck-mode}), which
enables syntax checking in every supported language.  If a syntax checking tool
is not available, Flycheck fails gracefully, does not enable syntax checking,
and just indicates the failure in the mode line.

@subsubsection Built-in syntax checkers


@strong{Flymake} supports Java, Makefiles, Perl, PHP, TeX/LaTeX and XML.  Notably, it
does @emph{not} support Emacs Lisp.  A third-party Flymake fork@footnote{https://github.com/illusori/emacs-flymake} supports more
languages, though.  Furthermore there are many recipes for other languages on
the Flymake page@footnote{http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FlyMake} in the EmacsWiki, and many extension packages for other
languages in the popular ELPA archive MELPA@footnote{http://melpa.org/}.

@strong{Flycheck} provides support for 43 languages (see
@ref{5,,Supported languages}) with 73 syntax checkers, most of
them contributed by the community.  Notably, Flycheck does @emph{not} support Java
and Makefiles.

@node Definition of new syntax checkers,,Built-in syntax checkers,Syntax checkers
@anchor{guide/flycheck-versus-flymake definition-of-new-syntax-checkers}@anchor{18}
@subsubsection Definition of new syntax checkers


@strong{Flymake} does not provide a single function to define a new syntax checker.
Instead, one has to define an “init” function, which returns the command, and
add this function to @code{flymake-allowed-file-name-masks}.  Additionally, one has
to add the error patterns to @code{flymake-err-line-patterns}.  As such, defining a
syntax checker is difficult for users who are not familiar with Emacs Lisp.
flymake-easy@footnote{https://github.com/purcell/flymake-easy} provides an easier way to define new syntax checkers, though.

@strong{Flycheck} provides a single function @ref{19,,flycheck-define-checker} to
define a new syntax checker.  This function uses a declarative syntax, which is
easy to understand even for users unfamiliar with Emacs Lisp.  In fact, many
syntax checkers in Flycheck were contributed by the community@footnote{https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues?labels=checker&milestone=&page=1&state=closed}.

For example, the Perl checker in Flymake is defined as follows.

@example
(defun flymake-perl-init ()
  (let* ((temp-file   (flymake-init-create-temp-buffer-copy
                       'flymake-create-temp-inplace))
         (local-file  (file-relative-name
                       temp-file
                       (file-name-directory buffer-file-name))))
    (list "perl" (list "-wc " local-file))))

(defcustom flymake-allowed-file-name-masks
  '(;; …
    ("\\.p[ml]\\'" flymake-perl-init)
    ;; …
    ))

(defvar flymake-err-line-patterns ; regexp file-idx line-idx col-idx (optional) text-idx(optional), match-end to end of string is error text
  (append
   '(;; …
     ;; perl
     ("\\(.*\\) at \\([^ \n]+\\) line \\([0-9]+\\)[,.\n]" 2 3 nil 1)
     ;; …
     )
   ;; …
  ))
@end example

Whereas Flycheck's definition of the same checker looks like this:

@example
(flycheck-define-checker perl
  "A Perl syntax checker using the Perl interpreter.

See URL `http://www.perl.org'."
  :command ("perl" "-w" "-c" source)
  :error-patterns
  ((error line-start (minimal-match (message))
          " at " (file-name) " line " line
          (or "." (and ", " (zero-or-more not-newline))) line-end))
  :modes (perl-mode cperl-mode))
@end example

@subsection Functions as syntax checkers


@strong{Flymake} cannot check a buffer with a custom Emacs Lisp function.

@strong{Flycheck} provides the @ref{1b,,flycheck-define-generic-checker} function
to define a syntax checker based on an arbitrary Emacs Lisp function.  Flycheck
supports synchronous as well as asynchronous functions, and provides simple
callback-based protocol to communicate the status of syntax checks.  This allows
Flycheck to use persistent background processes for syntax checking.  For
instance, flycheck-ocaml@footnote{https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck-ocaml} uses a running Merlin@footnote{https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin} process to check OCaml
buffers, which is much easier and faster than invoking the OCaml compiler.

@anchor{guide/flycheck-versus-flymake customization-of-syntax-checkers}@anchor{1c}
@subsection Customization of syntax checkers


@strong{Flymake} does not provide built-in means to customize syntax checkers.
Instead, when defining a new syntax checker, the user needs to declare
customization variables explicitly and explicitly check their value in the init
function.

@strong{Flycheck} provides built-in functions to add customization variables to
syntax checkers and splice the value of these variables into the argument list
of a syntax checking tool.  Many syntax checkers in Flycheck provide
customization variables.  For instance, you can customize the enabled warnings
for C with @ref{1d,,flycheck-clang-warnings}.  Flycheck also tries to
automatically find configuration files for syntax checkers.

@subsubsection Executables of syntax checkers


@strong{Flymake} does not provide built-in means to change the executable of a syntax
checker.

@strong{Flycheck} implicitly defines a variable to set the path of a syntax checker
tool for each defined syntax checker, and provides the interactive command
@ref{1f,,flycheck-set-checker-executable} to change the executable used in a
buffer.

@node Syntax checker selection,Error levels,Customization of syntax checkers,Detailed review
@anchor{guide/flycheck-versus-flymake syntax-checker-selection}@anchor{20}
@subsection Syntax checker selection


@strong{Flymake} selects syntax checkers based on file name patterns in
@code{flymake-allowed-file-name-masks}.  Effectively, this duplicates the existing
logic Emacs uses to choose the right major mode, but lacks its flexibility and
power.  For instance, Flymake cannot pick a syntax checker based on the shebang
of a file.

@strong{Flycheck} uses the major mode to select a syntax checker.  This reuses the
existing sophisticated logic Emcas uses to choose and configure major modes.
Flycheck can easily select a Python syntax checker for a Python script without
file extension, but with proper shebang, simply because Emacs correctly chooses
Python Mode for such a file.

@node Custom predicates,Manual selection,,Syntax checker selection
@anchor{guide/flycheck-versus-flymake custom-predicates}@anchor{21}
@subsubsection Custom predicates


@strong{Flymake} does not allow for custom predicates to implement more complex logic
for syntax checker selection.  For instance, Flymake cannot use different syntax
checkers for buffer depending on the value of a local variable.

However, flymake-easy@footnote{https://github.com/purcell/flymake-easy} patches Flymake to allow for custom syntax checkers per
buffer.  This does not happen automatically though.  The user still needs to
explicitly register a syntax checker in a major mode hook.

@strong{Flycheck} supports custom predicate function.  It uses these to implement the
shell script syntax checkers, for instance.  Emacs uses a single major mode for
various shell script types (e.g. Bash, Zsh, POSIX Shell, etc.), so Flycheck
additionally uses a custom predicate to look at the value of the variable
@code{sh-shell} in Sh Mode buffers, to determine which shell to use for syntax
checking.

@node Manual selection,Multiple syntax checkers per buffer,Custom predicates,Syntax checker selection
@anchor{guide/flycheck-versus-flymake manual-selection}@anchor{22}
@subsubsection Manual selection


@strong{Flymake} does not provide means to manually select a specific syntax checker,
either interactively, or via local variables.

@strong{Flycheck} provides the local variable @ref{23,,flycheck-checker} to
explicitly use a specific syntax checker for a buffer, and the command
@ref{24,,flycheck-select-checker} to set this variable interactively.

@node Multiple syntax checkers per buffer,,Manual selection,Syntax checker selection
@anchor{guide/flycheck-versus-flymake multiple-syntax-checkers-per-buffer}@anchor{25}
@subsubsection Multiple syntax checkers per buffer


@strong{Flymake} can only use a single syntax checker per buffer.  Effectively, the
user can only use a single tool to check a buffer, for instance either PHP Mess
Detector or PHP CheckStyle.  Third party extensions to Flycheck work around this
limitation by supplying custom shell scripts to call multiple syntax checking
tools at once.

@strong{Flycheck} can easily apply multiple syntax checkers per buffer.  For
instance, Flycheck will check PHP files with PHP CLI first to find syntax
errors, then with PHP MessDetector to additionally find idiomatic and semantic
errors, and eventually with PHP CheckStyle to find stylistic errors.  The user
will see all errors reported by all of these utilities in the buffer.

@node Error levels,Error identifiers,Syntax checker selection,Detailed review
@anchor{guide/flycheck-versus-flymake error-levels}@anchor{26}
@subsection Error levels


@strong{Flymake} supports error and warning messages.  The pattern of warning
messages is @emph{hard-coded} in Emacs 24.3, and only became customizable in upcoming
Emacs 24.4.  The patterns to parse messages are kept separate from the actual
syntax checker.

The third-party Flymake fork@footnote{https://github.com/illusori/emacs-flymake} also supports info messages, and makes the
pattern of warning messages customizable as well.

@strong{Flycheck} supports error, warning and info messages.  The patterns to parse
messages of different levels are part of the syntax checker definition, and thus
specific to each syntax checker.  Flycheck allows to define new error levels for
use in custom syntax checkers with @ref{27,,flycheck-define-error-level}.

@node Error identifiers,Error parsing,Error levels,Detailed review
@anchor{guide/flycheck-versus-flymake error-identifiers}@anchor{28}
@subsection Error identifiers


@strong{Flymake} does not support unique identifiers for different kinds of errors.

@strong{Flycheck} supports unique identifiers for different kinds of errors, if a
syntax checker provides these.  The identifiers appear in the error list and in
error display, and can be copied independently, for instance for use in an
inline suppression comment, or to search the web for a particular kind of error.

@node Error parsing,Error message display,Error identifiers,Detailed review
@anchor{guide/flycheck-versus-flymake error-parsing}@anchor{29}
@subsection Error parsing


@strong{Flymake} parses the output of syntax checker tools with regular expressions
only.  As it splits the output by lines regardless of the regular expressions,
it does not support error messages spanning multiple lines (such as returned by
the Emacs Lisp byte compiler or by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler).

flymake-easy@footnote{https://github.com/purcell/flymake-easy} overrides internal Flymake functions to support multiline error
messages.

@strong{Flycheck} can use regular expressions as well as custom parsing functions.
By means of such functions, it can parse JSON, XML or other structured output
formats.  Flycheck includes some ready-to-use parsing functions for well-known
output formats, such as Checkstyle XML.  By parsing structured output format,
Flycheck can handle arbitrarily complex error messages.  Also, with regular
expressions it uses the error patterns to split the output into tokens, and thus
handles multiline messages just as well.

@node Error message display,Error list,Error parsing,Detailed review
@anchor{guide/flycheck-versus-flymake error-message-display}@anchor{2a}
@subsection Error message display


In GUI frames, @strong{Flymake} shows error messages in a tool tip, if the user
hovers the mouse over an error location.  It does not provide means to show
error messages in a TTY frame, or with the keyboard only.


The third-party library flymake-cursor@footnote{http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/flymake-cursor.el} shows Flymake error messages at point
in the echo area, by overriding internal Flymake functions.

@strong{Flycheck} shows error message tool tips as well, but also displays error
messages in the echo area, if the point is at an error location.  This feature
is fully customizable via @ref{2b,,flycheck-display-errors-function}.

@node Syntax checking,Checking for changes,,Resource consumption
@anchor{guide/flycheck-versus-flymake syntax-checking}@anchor{2e}
@subsubsection Syntax checking


@strong{Flymake} starts a syntax check after every change, regardless of whether the
buffer is visible in a window or not.  It does not limit the number of
concurrent syntax checks.  As such, Flymake starts many concurrent syntax
checks, if many buffers are changed at the same time (e.g. after a VCS revert),
which is known to freeze Emacs temporarily.

The third-party Flymake fork@footnote{https://github.com/illusori/emacs-flymake} limits the number of concurrent syntax checks.
It does not take care to check visible buffers first, though.

@strong{Flycheck} does not conduct syntax checks in buffers which are not visible in
any window.  Instead it defers syntax checks in such buffers until after the
buffer is visible again.  Hence, Flycheck does only start as many concurrent
syntax checks as there are visible windows in the current Emacs session.

@node Checking for changes,,Syntax checking,Resource consumption
@anchor{guide/flycheck-versus-flymake checking-for-changes}@anchor{2f}
@subsubsection Checking for changes


@strong{Flymake} uses a @emph{separate} timer (in @code{flymake-timer}) to periodically check
for changes in each buffer.  These timers run even if the corresponding buffers
do not change.  This is known to cause considerable CPU load with many open
buffers.

The third-party Flymake fork@footnote{https://github.com/illusori/emacs-flymake} uses a single global timer to check for changes.
This greatly reduces the CPU load, but still consumes some marginal CPU, even if
Emacs is idle and not in use currently.

@strong{Flycheck} does not use timers at all to check for changes.  Instead it
registers a handler for Emacs' built-in @code{after-change-functions} hook, which is
run after changes to the buffer.  This handler is only invoked when the buffer
actually changed, and starts a one-shot timer to delay the syntax check until
the editing stopped for a short time, to save resources and avoid checking
half-finished editing.

@subsection Unit tests


@strong{Flymake} does not have a test suite at all.

@strong{Flycheck} has unit tests for all built-in syntax checkers, and for large
parts of the underlying machinery and API.  Contributed syntax checkers are
required to have test cases.  The tests are continuously run on Travis CI@footnote{https://travis-ci.org/flycheck/flycheck}.

the corresponding checkers programs, and use
@ref{3a,,flycheck-describe-checker} to get help about specific checkers inside
Emacs.

For instance, for Python you need either Flake8@footnote{https://flake8.readthedocs.org/} or Pylint@footnote{http://www.pylint.org/}, which can be
installed with @code{pip install flake8} and @code{pip install pylint} respectively.

Generally you can install the required external checker programs with the
standard package manager of the corresponding programming languages
(e.g. Rubygems for Ruby, NPM for Javascript).  Many checker programs are also
available in the package repositories of popular Linux distributions, or as
Formula for the OS X package manager Homebrew@footnote{http://brew.sh/}.

When Flycheck should check syntax automatically.

This variable is a list of events that may trigger syntax checks.
The following events are known:

@code{`save'}
     Check syntax immediately after the buffer was saved.

@code{`idle-change'}
     Check syntax a short time (see @ref{58,,`flycheck-idle-change-delay'})
     after the last change to the buffer.

@code{`new-line'}
     Check syntax immediately after a new line was inserted into
     the buffer.

@code{`mode-enabled'}
     Check syntax immediately when @ref{54,,`flycheck-mode'} is enabled.

Flycheck performs a syntax checks only on events, which are
contained in this list.  For instance, if the value of this
variable is @code{(mode-enabled save)}, Flycheck will only check if
the mode is enabled or the buffer was saved, but never after

A syntax checker in @ref{5e,,flycheck-checkers} that is @strong{not} in
@ref{5f,,flycheck-disabled-checkers} is an @ref{62,,enabled syntax checker}.

Flycheck starts to check the current buffer with the first enabled and suitable
syntax checker from @ref{5e,,flycheck-checkers}.  See @code{Languages and syntax
checkers} for a list of all available syntax checkers.  If there is no enabled
and suitable checker for the current, Flycheck does not check this buffer.  It
does @strong{not} signal an error.  Instead a special mode line indicator informs
about this state.  See @ref{63,,Mode line reporting} for details.

You can also force Flycheck to use a specific syntax checker for the current

@subsection Syntax checker executables


For each syntax checker, there is a buffer-local, customizable variable
@code{flycheck-@var{checker}-executable}, where @var{checker} is the name of
the syntax checker.

The value of this variable is either nil, or a string.  In the former case,
Flycheck uses the default executable from the syntax checker definition when
executing the syntax checker.  In the latter case, it uses the value of the
variable as executable.

Use these variables to override the executable from the definition per buffer.
For instance, you could use a different Emacs version with the @code{emacs-lisp} or
@code{emacs-lisp-checkdoc}.

You can either set these variables directly in your @code{init.el}, or change
them interactively:

@geindex flycheck-set-checker-executable; Emacs Lisp command

@deffn {Command} C@w{-}c ! e
@anchor{guide/usage el function flycheck-set-checker-executable}@anchor{1f}
@deffnx {Command} M@w{-}x flycheck@w{-}set@w{-}checker@w{-}executable

@subsection Syntax checker options


Some syntax checkers can be configured via options.  See @ref{39,,Supported languages} for a
complete list of options for each syntax checkers.

All options are customizable via @code{M-x customize-group RET
flycheck-options}, and automatically buffer-local to easily set them in hooks.

Options are mainly intended to be used by @ref{b,,extensions}, and via File or Directory Local variables.  See
@ref{File Variables,,,emacs} and @ref{Directory Variables,,,emacs}
respectively.

@node Syntax checker configuration files,,Syntax checker options,Configuring syntax checkers
@anchor{guide/usage syntax-checker-configuration-files}@anchor{6b}@anchor{guide/usage id8}@anchor{6c}
@subsection Syntax checker configuration files


Some syntax checkers also read configuration files, denoted by associated
@emph{configuration file variables}.  See @ref{39,,Supported languages} of these variables.

All options are customizable via @code{M-x customize-group RET
flycheck-config-files}, and automatically buffer-local to easily set them in
hooks.  You may also set them via File or Directory Local variables.  See
@ref{File Variables,,,emacs} and @ref{Directory Variables,,,emacs}
respectively.

When set to a string, Flycheck tries to locate the configuration file using the
functions in @ref{6d,,flycheck-locate-config-file-functions} and passes the name
of the file to the syntax checker:

@geindex flycheck-locate-config-file-functions; Emacs Lisp user option

@deffn {User Option} flycheck@w{-}locate@w{-}config@w{-}file@w{-}functions

@cartouche
@quotation Variable properties 
This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.  
@end quotation
@end cartouche

@format
Functions to locate syntax checker configuration files.

Each function in this hook must accept two arguments: The value
of the configuration file variable, and the syntax checker
symbol.  It must return either a string with an absolute path to
the configuration file, or nil, if it cannot locate the
configuration file.

The functions in this hook are called in order of appearance, until a
function returns non-nil.  The configuration file returned by that
function is then given to the syntax checker if it exists.

This variable is an abnormal hook.  See Info
node @ref{Hooks,,,elisp}.
@end format
@end deffn

With the default value of this variable, configuration files are located by the
following algorithm:


@enumerate 

@item 
If the configuration file variable contains a path a directory
separator, expand the path against the buffer's default directory and
use the resulting path as configuration file.

@item 
If the buffer has a file name, search the buffer's directory and any
ancestors thereof for the configuration file.

@item 
Eventually attempt to locate the configuration file in the user's home
directory.
@end enumerate

If any of these steps succeeds, the subsequent steps are not executed.

the number of errors and warnings in the mode line.

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
To avoid flooding the buffer with excessive errors, Flycheck discards errors

@ref{7f,,flycheck-error-list-highlight}:

@section Copying (killing) errors


Frequently, it's convenient to not only see the error messages, but to also copy
them into the kill ring:

@geindex flycheck-copy-errors-as-kill; Emacs Lisp command

@deffn {Command} C@w{-}c ! C@w{-}w
@anchor{guide/usage el function flycheck-copy-errors-as-kill}@anchor{85}
@deffnx {Command} M@w{-}x flycheck@w{-}copy@w{-}errors@w{-}as@w{-}kill

Copy all Flycheck error messages at the current point into kill ring.

Each error message is killed separately, so you can use @code{M-y} to cycle
among the killed messages after yanking the first one with @code{C-y}.
@end deffn


@deffn {Command} C@w{-}u C@w{-}c ! C@w{-}w

@deffnx {Command} C@w{-}u M@w{-}x flycheck@w{-}copy@w{-}errors@w{-}as@w{-}kill

Copy all Flycheck error messages @strong{and their IDs} at the current point into
kill ring.
@end deffn


@deffn {Command} M@w{-}0 C@w{-}c ! C@w{-}w

@deffnx {Command} M@w{-}0 M@w{-}x flycheck@w{-}copy@w{-}errors@w{-}as@w{-}kill

Copy all Flycheck error @strong{IDs} at the current point into kill ring.  This
command is particularly handy to copy an ID in order to add an inline
suppression comment.

@anchor{guide/usage navigating-errors}@anchor{86}@anchor{guide/usage navigating-and-jumping-to-errors}@anchor{87}
@section Navigating and jumping to errors


By default, Flycheck integrates into standard error navigation commands of
Emacs: @code{M-g n} (@code{next-error}) and @code{M-g p} (@code{previous-error}) will
navigate between Flycheck warnings and errors in the current buffer.  See
@ref{Compilation Mode,,,emacs} for more information about these commands.

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
@strong{Visible} compilation buffers (e.g. from @code{M-x compile}, @code{M-x
grep}, @code{M-x occur}, etc.) take precedence over Flycheck's error
navigation.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

If you find this integration annoying and would rather keep @code{M-g n}
confined to compilation buffers, you may disable it by setting
@ref{88,,flycheck-standard-error-navigation} to nil and re-enabling
@ref{54,,flycheck-mode} afterwards:

@geindex flycheck-standard-error-navigation; Emacs Lisp user option
@anchor{guide/usage el variable flycheck-standard-error-navigation}@anchor{88}
@deffn {User Option} flycheck@w{-}standard@w{-}error@w{-}navigation

@cartouche
@quotation Variable properties 
This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value satisfies the predicate @code{booleanp}. 
@end quotation
@end cartouche

@format
Whether to support error navigation with @code{`next-error'}.

If non-nil, enable navigation of Flycheck errors with
@code{`next-error'}, @code{`previous-error'} and @code{`first-error'}.  Otherwise,
these functions just navigate errors from compilation modes.

Flycheck error navigation with @ref{49,,`flycheck-next-error'},
@ref{4a,,`flycheck-previous-error'} and @ref{89,,`flycheck-first-error'} is always
enabled, regardless of the value of this variable.

Note that this setting only takes effect when @ref{54,,`flycheck-mode'} is
enabled.  Changing it will not affect buffers which already have
@ref{54,,`flycheck-mode'} enabled.
@end format


This user option was introduced, or its default value was changed, in version 0.15 of the flycheck package.

@end deffn

Since compilation buffers take precedence, Flycheck provides an independent set
of navigation commands which always navigate Flycheck errors regardless of
compilation buffers or @ref{88,,flycheck-standard-error-navigation}:

@geindex flycheck-next-error; Emacs Lisp command

@deffn {Command} C@w{-}c ! n
@anchor{guide/usage el function flycheck-next-error}@anchor{49}
@deffnx {Command} M@w{-}x flycheck@w{-}next@w{-}error

Jump to the next Flycheck error.

With prefix argument, jump forwards by as many errors as specified by
the prefix argument, e.g. @code{M-3 C-c ! n} will move to the 3rd error
from the current point.
@end deffn

@geindex flycheck-previous-error; Emacs Lisp command

@deffn {Command} C@w{-}c ! p
@anchor{guide/usage el function flycheck-previous-error}@anchor{4a}
@deffnx {Command} M@w{-}x flycheck@w{-}previous@w{-}error

Jump to the previous Flycheck error.

With prefix argument, jump backwards by as many errors as specified by
the prefix argument, e.g. @code{M-3 C-c ! p} will move to the 3rd
previous error from the current point.
@end deffn

@geindex flycheck-first-error; Emacs Lisp command
@anchor{guide/usage el function flycheck-first-error}@anchor{89}
@deffn {Command} M@w{-}x flycheck@w{-}first@w{-}error

Jump to the first Flycheck error.

With prefix argument, jump forwards to by as many errors as specified by
the prefix argument, e.g. @code{M-3 M-x flycheck-first-error} moves to
the 3rd error from the beginning of the buffer.
@end deffn

If @ref{88,,flycheck-standard-error-navigation} is @code{nil}, these commands are the
only way to navigate Flycheck errors.

By default, Flycheck's error navigation considers all error levels.  You can
specify a threshold for navigation with
@ref{8a,,flycheck-navigation-minimum-level}:

@geindex flycheck-navigation-minimum-level; Emacs Lisp user option
@anchor{guide/usage el variable flycheck-navigation-minimum-level}@anchor{8a}
@deffn {User Option} flycheck@w{-}navigation@w{-}minimum@w{-}level

@cartouche
@quotation Variable properties 
This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value satisfies the predicate @ref{8b,,flycheck-error-level-p}. 
@end quotation
@end cartouche

@format
The minimum level of errors to navigate.

If set to an error level, only navigate errors whose error level
is at least as severe as this one.  If nil, navigate all errors.
@end format


This user option was introduced, or its default value was changed, in version 0.21 of the flycheck package.

@node Mode line reporting,,Navigating and jumping to errors,Usage
@anchor{guide/usage id11}@anchor{8c}@anchor{guide/usage mode-line-reporting}@anchor{63}
@section Mode line reporting


Flycheck always indicates its state in the mode line:


@table @asis

@item @code{FlyC}

There are no errors in the current buffer.

@item @code{FlyC*}

A syntax check is being performed currently.

@item @code{FlyC:3/4}

There are three errors and four warnings in the current buffer.

@item @code{FlyC-}

Automatic syntax checker selection did not find a suitable syntax checker.
See @ref{5d,,Selecting syntax checkers} for more information.

@item @code{FlyC!}

The syntax check failed.  Inspect the @code{*Messages*} buffer for details.

@item @code{FlyC?}

The syntax check had a dubious result.  The definition of the syntax checker
may be flawed.  Inspect the @code{*Messages*} buffer for details.

This indicator should @strong{never} be displayed for built-in syntax checkers.
If it is, please report an issue to the Flycheck developers, as by
@ref{8d,,Reporting issues}.
@end table

Change @ref{8e,,flycheck-mode-line} to customize the mode line reporting:

@geindex flycheck-mode-line; Emacs Lisp user option
@anchor{guide/usage el variable flycheck-mode-line}@anchor{8e}
@deffn {User Option} flycheck@w{-}mode@w{-}line

@cartouche
@quotation Variable properties 
This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.  
@end quotation
@end cartouche

@format
Mode line lighter for Flycheck.

The value of this variable is a mode line template as in
@code{`mode-line-format'}.  See Info Node @ref{Mode Line Format,,,elisp} for
more information.  Note that it should contain a _single_ mode
line construct only.

Customize this variable to change how Flycheck reports its status
in the mode line.  You may use @ref{8f,,`flycheck-mode-line-status-text'}
to obtain a human-readable status text, including an
error/warning count.

You may also assemble your own status text.  The current status
of Flycheck is available in @ref{90,,`flycheck-last-status-change'}.  The
errors in the current buffer are stored in
@ref{91,,`flycheck-current-errors'}, and the function
@ref{92,,`flycheck-count-errors'} may be used to obtain the number of
errors grouped by error level.

Set this variable to nil to disable the mode line completely.

@chapter Supported languages


Flycheck supports the following 43 languages with
73 syntax checkers.

Each language has one or more syntax checkers, whose names follow a
@code{@var{language}-@var{tool}} convention, where @var{language} is the
programming language supported by this syntax checker, and @var{tool} the
specific syntax checker tool.

There are some 3rd party extensions which add support for more languages:


@itemize -

@item 
flycheck-ledger@footnote{https://github.com/purcell/flycheck-ledger} adds a syntax checker for the Ledger@footnote{http://ledger-cli.org/} accounting tool.

@item 
flycheck-mercury@footnote{https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck-mercury} adds a syntax checker for the Mercury@footnote{http://mercurylang.org/} language.

@item 
flycheck-ocaml@footnote{https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck-ocaml} adds a syntax checker for OCaml, using the Merlin@footnote{https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin} tool.

@format
An alist mapping flake8 error IDs to Flycheck error levels.

Each item in this list is a cons cell @code{(PATTERN . LEVEL)} where
PATTERN is a regular expression matched against the error ID, and
LEVEL is a Flycheck error level symbol.

Each PATTERN is matched in the order of appearance in this list
against the error ID.  If it matches the ID, the level of the
corresponding error is set to LEVEL.  An error that is not
matched by any PATTERN defaults to warning level.

This option exists because flake8 categorises errors by the
underlying tool that produced them (e.g. F for pyflakes messages,
E for pep8 messages, etc.).  These categorisations do not map
directly to Flycheck error levels.  Hence, this option exists to
allow for a custom mapping.  The default value handles all of the
built-in tools of flake8, and naming errors from pep8-naming.

@item chaining

In some languages, multiple @ref{64,,syntax checkers} can
be applied to a buffer.  In such a case, each syntax checker specifies
which checkers are to be used after it and when.  The result is a “syntax
checker chain”, specifying all syntax checkers to be applied to the
buffer.

For instance, Haskell buffers are first checked with GHC for syntax and
type errors, and then with @code{hlint} for idiomatic and semantic mistakes.
Hence, the syntax checker chain consists of @ref{eb,,haskell-ghc}
and @ref{ec,,haskell-hlint}.

@subsection Flycheck 0.22


@*date: 
Dec 23, 2014


@*version: 
0.22


Flycheck 0.22 comes with some major new features, most notably generic syntax
checkers and many improvements and bug fixes.  Unfortunately, some of these
changes break backwards compatibility.

This announcement covers the most important changes.  For details, please refer
to the @ref{161,,Changelog}.

@subsubsection Breaking changes


@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
The addition of generic syntax checkers lead to some breaking changes to the
internals of syntax checker definitions.  Due to the way macros work in Emacs
Lisp @strong{all packages depending on Flycheck} must be recompiled after
upgrading to Flycheck 0.22!

We hope that this will be the last breaking change of this kind, since the
definition of syntax checkers is now wrapped into functions, and the
@ref{19,,flycheck-define-checker} macro just provides some syntactic sugar for
definitions.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

Error parsers must explicitly set @ref{163,,flycheck-error buffer} and
@ref{164,,flycheck-error checker} of new @ref{165,,flycheck-error} objects
now.  This is another consequence of generic syntax checkers.

@code{flycheck-perlcritic-verbosity} and @code{flycheck-copy-messages-as-kill} are
obsolete now, in favour of @ref{10a,,flycheck-perlcritic-severity} and
@ref{85,,flycheck-copy-errors-as-kill} respectively.
@code{flycheck-google-messages} has been removed completely.

@ref{24,,flycheck-select-checker} cannot select disabled syntax checkers
anymore.

Syntax checker options and configuration file variables are not buffer-local
anymore, with some exceptions.  Consequently you can now use @code{setq} to set their
global value, and you @strong{must} use @code{setq-local} to set them locally.  Variables
set via file or directory variables are not affected by this change.

@subsubsection Setup


The new @ref{5a,,flycheck-verify-setup} command provides information about all
applicable syntax checkers, and lists potential problems.  It is intended to
help you uncover issues in your Flycheck setup.

@end example

please replace it with:

@example
(setq flycheck-emacs-lisp-load-path 'inherit)

The new syntax checker @ref{11c,,python-pycompile} uses the built-in byte
compiler of Python to check a buffer for syntax errors.  It is provided as a
last resort for basic syntax checking of Python code, if neither pylint nor
flake8 are installed.

The error levels of @ref{115,,python-flake8} can now be customized via
@ref{116,,flycheck-flake8-error-level-alist}.  The default value handles the
standard plugins of flake8, and the 3rd party pep8-naming plugin.  You can add
custom patterns to this option to add support for other flake8 plugins.

@ref{11a,,python-pylint} now has correct error columns.

@subsubsection Syntax checking improvements


Flycheck now parses errors faster, because it does not longer access the file
system to check the file of each parsed errors, and it protects against
excessive error reporting by automatically disabling syntax checkers that try to
report too many errors.  The threshold is customizable via the new
@ref{71,,flycheck-checker-error-threshold} option.

@subsubsection Error list improvements

Typing @code{g} in the error list will re-check the source buffer, and refresh
the error list afterwards.

@node Generic syntax checkers,Error IDs,Error list improvements,Flycheck 0 22
@anchor{guide/releases/flycheck-0 22 generic-syntax-checkers}@anchor{172}
@subsubsection Generic syntax checkers


Flycheck now supports “generic” syntax checkers, which call arbitrary
synchronous or asynchronous Emacs Lisp functions to check a buffer.  The new
function @ref{1b,,flycheck-define-generic-checker} defines a new generic
syntax checker which calls a given function to conduct a syntax check.

Syntax checkers for external commands are now called “command syntax checkers”,
and implemented as a special kind of generic syntax checkers.
@ref{19,,flycheck-define-checker} still defines a command syntax checker.  The
new function @ref{173,,flycheck-define-command-checker} is a non-macro variant
of @ref{1b,,flycheck-define-generic-checker}.

@node Error IDs,Unit test library for Flycheck,Generic syntax checkers,Flycheck 0 22
@anchor{guide/releases/flycheck-0 22 error-ids}@anchor{174}
@subsubsection Error IDs


Syntax checkers can now add “IDs” to errors, which shall uniquely identify a
particular kind of error.  These IDs are used by Flycheck and Flycheck
extensions to identify errors, particularly in future extensions such as error
fixers.

The new @code{id} form for error patterns allows to parse IDs.  Error parsers and
generic syntax checkers can set the @ref{175,,flycheck-error id} slot to add
IDs.  The @ref{176,,flycheck-parse-checkstyle} parser automatically adds IDs
from the @code{source} attribute of errors.

The new error filters @ref{177,,flycheck-dequalify-error-ids} and
@ref{178,,flycheck-remove-error-ids} manipulate IDs of parsed errors.  The
former removes qualifications from error IDs, turning @code{Foo.Bar.E1} into @code{E1}.
The latter completely removes error IDs from parsed errors, for use in cases
where the syntax checker only outputs bogus IDs.

All built-in syntax checkers were updated to parse IDs, if possible.

The error list now shows these IDs, and @ref{85,,flycheck-copy-errors-as-kill}
can put them into the kill ring.

@node Unit test library for Flycheck,,Error IDs,Flycheck 0 22
@anchor{guide/releases/flycheck-0 22 unit-test-library-for-flycheck}@anchor{179}
@subsubsection Unit test library for Flycheck


The new library @code{flycheck-ert} provides assertions and utilities to write unit
tests for Flycheck syntax checkers.  The library is part of all Flycheck
packages.

3rd party extensions may use this library to write test cases for their syntax
checkers.  @ref{17a,,Flycheck ERT API} documents the interface of this library.

@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
The value of the @code{:next-checkers} property changed in a
backwards-incompatible way.  The custom symbols @code{no-errors} and
@code{warnings-only} are gone.  Instead the first item of each cons cell is the
@emph{maximum permissible error level} now.  For instance, @code{:next-checkers
((no-errors . foo))} now becomes @code{:next-checkers ((warning . foo))}.  Please
update all your syntax checker definitions accordingly.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

The @ref{f4,,html-tidy} syntax checker does not check Web Mode buffers
anymore, because will frequently contain strictly invalid HTML.

The @ref{c7,,d-dmd} syntax checker requires DMD 2.066 or newer now, to
add columns to error locations.

The error list highlights all errors at the current line now.  Highlighting of
errors at point, i.e. the @code{flycheck-error-list-highlight-at-point} face and
related functionality, was removed, because it would frequently cause odd and
confusing highlighting.

buffer and in the error list, but they are skipped in any of the navigation
commands.

The new function @ref{7a,,flycheck-display-error-messages-unless-error-list}
shows messages of the errors at point in the echo area, but only if the error
list is @emph{not} visible.  Use this function for
@ref{2b,,flycheck-display-errors-function} to make use of this feature.

@subsubsection Syntax checker definition and extension


The @code{:next-checkers} property requires a maximum permissible error level now.
The custom predicates @code{no-errors} and @code{warnings-only} are gone.

Syntax checker definitions can use the new @code{null-device} symbol to add the name
of the system null device (e.g. @code{/dev/null} on Unix, @code{NUL} on Windows) to the
syntax checker arguments.  Typically, this would be used to ignore files
generated by the syntax checker.  See the definition of the
@ref{ac,,c/c++-gcc} syntax checker for an example.

The new function @ref{188,,flycheck-add-mode} adds major modes to existing
syntax checkers, by extending the @code{:modes} property.

@subsubsection C/C++


C/C++ can now be checked with GCC (@ref{ac,,c/c++-gcc}) as an alternative
to Clang.  GCC supports the same options as Clang, with the exception of
@ref{a3,,flycheck-clang-blocks}.

The Clang syntax checker now supports the Clang block syntax with the new option
@ref{a3,,flycheck-clang-blocks}, and allows to disable exceptions with
@ref{a9,,flycheck-clang-no-exceptions}.

Furthermore, temporary files for the Clang syntax checker are now created in the
system temporary directory.

@subsubsection Rust


Support for Rust creates is greatly improved.  You can now specify the type of
crate to check with @code{flycheck-rust-crate-type}, and the root file of the crate
with @code{flycheck-rust-crate-root}.  The former avoids redundant warnings due to
unused code, and the latter helps to resolve relative module references.

Flycheck also parses info messages from Rust now.

@subsubsection Error list improvements


The error list (@ref{4b,,flycheck-list-errors}) got a bunch of improvements:


@itemize -

@item 
Errors can now be sorted by error level and by error location, either by
clicking on the headers of @code{line} and @code{level} respectively, or by pressing
@code{S} when the point is on the text of the corresponding column.

@item 
Pressing @code{RET} on any error in the error list now jumps immediately to
the error location.

@item 
@code{n} and @code{p} now move by errors instead by lines, even with
multi-line error messages, and display the error location in another window
while navigating.

@subsubsection User interface improvements


The mode line indicator of Flycheck is now customizable with
@ref{8e,,flycheck-mode-line}, which is a mode line template (see
@ref{Mode Line Format,,,elisp}).  The mode line of the error list buffer is
customizable as well, with @code{flycheck-error-list-mode-line}.

The Flycheck menu at @emph{Tools -> Syntax Checking} was improved.  It
now provides an item to toggle Flycheck Mode in the current buffer.  Items that
are not available currently are now disabled.  The menu is also shown on the
mode line indicator now.

@ref{198,,flycheck-compile} now prompts for a syntax checker to use, defaulting
to the last used for the current buffer.

When Flycheck asks for a syntax checker in the minibuffer, it now presents a
reasonable default.

@node New features,Bug fixes,Languages,Flycheck 0 19
@anchor{guide/releases/flycheck-0 19 new-features}@anchor{1a6}
@subsubsection New features


Syntax checkers may now use the @code{:error-filter} argument to
@ref{19,,flycheck-define-checker} to apply a function to all errors after
parsing.  The function is given the list of parsed errors, and shall return the
list of errors that Flycheck is to use as the result of the syntax checker.  It
may modify the list and all error objects therein in-place.

The new option @ref{50,,flycheck-keymap-prefix} lets you change the prefix key
used by Flycheck.  The default is still @code{C-c !}.

@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
The Flycheck manual assumes that you are using the default prefix key.  You
are encouraged to leave the prefix key unchanged, and instead add your own
custom bindings to the Flycheck key map:

@example
(eval-after-load 'flycheck
  '(define-key flycheck-mode-map (kbd "<f8>") #'flycheck-list-errors))
@end example
@end quotation
@end cartouche

Likewise, you now can configure the prefix of in-place temporary files created
by Flycheck with @ref{5b,,flycheck-temp-prefix}.

@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
Changing the prefix may break syntax checkers.  In doubt, stick to the
default prefix.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

@subsection Flycheck 0.18


@*date: 
Mar 24, 2014


@*version: 
0.18


Today, we release Flycheck 0.18.

It's quite some time since the last release, but there are not many big changes,
as Flycheck becomes more and more mature, and slowly approaches a 1.0 release.

@subsubsection Breaking changes


There are some small breaking changes.  Most notably, the naming conventions of
various shell script syntax checkers were changed.  All of them now use the
prefix @code{sh-}, and the former @code{sh-} checkers now have the prefix @code{sh-posix-}.
This affects their executable variables as well.

Furthermore, the version requirements for some syntax checker tools changed:


@itemize -

@item 
@ref{12f,,rust}  needs upcoming Rust 0.10 now, because Flycheck followed
backwards-incompatible upstream changes in the @code{rustc} options.

@item 
@ref{124,,rst-sphinx} needs Sphinx 1.2 now, because Flycheck uses a
special writer now, which is not present in previous releases.
@end itemize

@node Syntax checkers<2>,Bug fixes<2>,Breaking changes<5>,Flycheck 0 18
@anchor{guide/releases/flycheck-0 18 syntax-checkers}@anchor{1ae}
@subsubsection Syntax checkers


Flycheck can now check BSD Makefile with BSD Make as well.  The
@ref{105,,make} syntax checker does not use GNU Make specific options
anymore, and will work with any POSIX compatible variant of Make.

Go syntax checking got a major update with new syntax checkers based on Golint@footnote{https://github.com/golang/lint}
(@ref{e0,,go-golint}) and @code{go tool vet} (@ref{e1,,go-vet}).  Go now
has one of the most complete and powerful syntax checker chains in Flycheck.

Support for Perl and for shell scripts was greatly improved by introducing two
new syntax checkers:


@itemize -

@item 
@ref{109,,perl-perlcritic} checks Perl with the powerful Perl-Critic@footnote{https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic}
tool.

@item 
@ref{142,,sh-shellcheck} checks Shell scripts with the awesome
Shellcheck@footnote{https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck} tool, which finds all sorts of idiomatic and semantics mistakes
in shell scripts of various shell languages, and will greatly improve your
shell scripting.
@end itemize

D users can now tell @ref{c7,,d-dmd} about include directories with the
new option @ref{c8,,flycheck-dmd-include-path}.  Likewise, Rust users can use
@ref{133,,flycheck-rust-library-path} now.

@subsubsection Bug fixes


As always, a good deal of bugs and issues was fixed:


@itemize -

@item 
@ref{113,,puppet-lint} includes the name of the corresponding check in
the error message now.

@item 
@ref{123,,rst} handles @code{.. include::} directives with relative file
names now.

@item 
@ref{124,,rst-sphinx} will no longer choke if the document being checked
contains custom nodes without @code{text}  writers.

@item 
@ref{12f,,rust} will not longer emit pointless warnings about missing
@code{main} functions in library creates.

@item 
Various error parsing problems were corrected in @ref{9f,,c/c++-clang},
@ref{e2,,go-build} and @ref{e3,,go-test}.

@subsection Flycheck 0.17


@*date:

@*version: 
0.17



Flycheck 0.17 was released today.  Though it's just about two weeks since the
last release, there are quite some changes.

@anchor{guide/releases/flycheck-0 17 breaking-changes}@anchor{1b4}
@subsubsection Breaking changes


The default value of @ref{65,,flycheck-completion-system} was changed to @code{nil},
i.e. Flycheck now uses plain @code{completing-read} as default completion system.  To
restore the previous default (i.e. IDO), customize it with @code{M-x
customize-variable RET flycheck-completion-system} or add the following to your
@code{init.el}:

@example
(eval-after-load 'flycheck '(setq flycheck-completion-system 'ido))
@end example

Also, @ref{92,,flycheck-count-errors} was changed to count errors of all
levels.  It returns an alist mapping error levels to the amount of errors of
that level.

@node New online manual,Syntax checkers<3>,Breaking changes<6>,Flycheck 0 17
@anchor{guide/releases/flycheck-0 17 new-online-manual}@anchor{1b5}
@subsubsection New online manual


The most notable change is the new online documentation at
@indicateurl{http://flycheck.readthedocs.org}, which replaces the old online manual at
@indicateurl{http://flycheck.github.io}.  The latter now redirects to the former.

The new manual is written with Sphinx@footnote{http://sphinx-doc.org} instead of Texinfo@footnote{http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/}.  The underlying
markup is ReStructuredText@footnote{http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html}, which is simpler, less cluttered, and more powerful
than the TeX dialect of Texinfo@footnote{http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/}.  It is also more popular, as nowadays Sphinx
has become a standard tool among Python developers, and is also increasingly
used with other languages as well.  For instance, the LLVM documentation@footnote{http://llvm.org/docs/} is
written in Sphinx.

Besides providing a better HTML documentation, we hope that the new manual
lowers the barrier to external contributors and increases the amount of
contributions to the documentation.

The documentation is now automatically re-build after each push to the Github
repository, so that @indicateurl{http://flycheck.readthedocs.org/en/latest} now always hosts
the up to date documentation.  Besides, there are separate sites for each
versioned release of Flycheck.  For instance,
@indicateurl{http://flycheck.readthedocs.org/en/0.17} now hosts the documentation of Flycheck
0.17 now.

Beyond the manual itself, the new documentation now also includes the release
notes, which were previously hosted at @indicateurl{http://www.lunaryorn.com}, and the
@ref{d,,comparison with Flymake}, which was previously
hosted at the Github Wiki of Flycheck.  The Github Wiki is disabled now, to make
all documentation available from a single place.

Unfortunately, the Info manual included in the Flycheck ELPA packages is
somewhat inferior now, because there is some idiomatic gap between Sphinx and
Texinfo.  It's still usable, though, and we hope to overcome the most striking
shortcomings over the time.

@anchor{guide/releases/flycheck-0 17 syntax-checkers}@anchor{1b6}@anchor{guide/releases/flycheck-0 17 llvm-documentation}@anchor{1b7}
@subsubsection Syntax checkers


Flycheck can now check GNU Makefiles (see [GH-321]@footnote{https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/321}) with the new @code{make-gmake}
syntax checker.

The @ref{12f,,rust} syntax checker now uses @code{--no-trans} to check for more
than just syntax errors.  For instance, it will report unused variables now.

As part of the transition to the new manual, Flycheck now provides a syntax
checker for Sphinx documents (@ref{124,,rst-sphinx}).  The
@ref{123,,rst} syntax checker does not check documents within a Sphinx
project anymore, do avoid false positives from Sphinx-specific markup.

ERuby@footnote{http://www.kuwata-lab.com/erubis/}, Handlebars@footnote{http://handlebarsjs.com/}, Racket@footnote{http://racket-lang.org/}, Texinfo@footnote{https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo}, and Verilog@footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog}.  Additionally, there are a
new syntax checker for Javascript (eslint@footnote{https://github.com/eslint/eslint}), Ruby (ruby-lint@footnote{https://github.com/YorickPeterse/ruby-lint}), and YAML
(js-yaml@footnote{https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml}).

@subsubsection Better Haskell support


Despite the aforementioned removal of Hdevtools, Haskell support made a leap
forward.  The GHC syntax checker resolves local imports properly now, and has
new options to change the search path and the package databases.

The brand-new flycheck-haskell@footnote{https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck-haskell} extension makes use of these variables to
configure the syntax checker properly in Cabal projects.  The extensions adds
all source directories of a Cabal project to the GHC search path, and enables
the package database of the project's Cabal sandbox.

@subsubsection Disable syntax checkers easily


Flycheck as a new customization options @ref{5f,,flycheck-disabled-checkers}, to
easily disable syntax checkers.

Previously, you needed to remove syntax checkers from
@ref{5e,,flycheck-checkers} to disable them, either via the Customization
interface, or by custom Emacs Lisp:

@example
(setq flycheck-checkers (delq 'emacs-lisp-checkdoc flycheck-checkers))
@end example

With the new variable, there is no need for this convoluted code anymore.
Instead, just set the variable:

@example
(setq flycheck-disabled-checkers '(emacs-lisp-checkdoc))
@end example

Even better, you can easily use this variable in file or directory variables.
For instance, you can use @code{M-x add-file-local-variable RET
flycheck-disabled-checkers RET (emacs-lisp-checkdoc)} in your @code{init.el} to
disable Checkdoc warnings while editing your @code{init.el}.

@anchor{guide/releases/flycheck-0 16 improved-error-list}@anchor{1c7}
@subsubsection Improved error list


This release continues the improvements to the error list started in the last
release.  The error list is now based on Tabulated List Mode (see [GH-230]@footnote{https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/230}), to
address a number of issues in the old Compile Mode-based error list
(e.g. misleading commands and menu items such as “Recompile”).

The new error list, which you can see in the screenshot above, fixes these
issues, and has an improved visual appearance.  The columns are aligned now, and
the superfluous file name is omitted.

@subsection Flycheck 0.15


@*date: 
Nov 15, 2013


@*version: 
0.15


I have the honour and pleasure to announce a new release of Flycheck, the
modern syntax-checking extension for Emacs.


It is three months since the last release, so this release brings quite a lot of
changes.  For a complete list of all changes, please read the complete list of
@ref{161,,Changelog}.  This article will just cover the most important changes.

@subsubsection Breaking changes


This release introduces three breaking changes.  Two of these are related to the
@ref{1cc,,new-error-list}:

@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
@code{flycheck-display-errors-in-list} is gone.  If you had previously set
@ref{2b,,flycheck-display-errors-function} to this function, @strong{remove} this
setting from your configuration.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

Besides, @code{flycheck-list-errors} does not take a prefix argument anymore.  It
cannot list errors at point any longer.

The third breaking change is the removal of @code{flycheck-declare-checker}, which
was obsolete already since the last release.  Unless you have custom syntax
checkers not yet ported to @ref{19,,flycheck-define-checker}, this won't affect
you in any way.  I am not aware of any 3rd party extension which still uses
@code{flycheck-declare-checker}.

@node New syntax checkers,New error list,Breaking changes<8>,Flycheck 0 15
@anchor{guide/releases/flycheck-0 15 new-syntax-checkers}@anchor{1cd}
@subsubsection New syntax checkers


Two new languages made it into this release:  YAML (using the YAML parser from
the Ruby standard library) and Slim@footnote{http://slim-lang.com}.

Additionally there are new syntax checkers for Javascript and PHP.  Flycheck can
check Javascript with Google's Closure Linter@footnote{https://code.google.com/p/closure-linter/}, in place of Jshint.  For PHP,
Flycheck now uses the PHP Mess Detector@footnote{http://phpmd.org/} to check for semantic errors, in
@emph{addition} to a syntax checks with PHP CLI and a style checks with PHP
CodeSniffer.

@anchor{guide/releases/flycheck-0 15 new-error-list}@anchor{1cc}@anchor{guide/releases/flycheck-0 15 id1}@anchor{1ce}
@subsubsection New error list


The error list at @code{C-c ! l} has been redesigned.

It is no longer a static list filled once by @code{C-c ! l}.  Instead, it
automatically updates after each syntax check, and follows the current window,
i.e. if you switch to another window, the error list is updated to show the
errors of the corresponding buffer.

Furthermore, the error list highlights the errors at point and at the current
line.  If you move the point to an error location, the error list automatically
scrolls to the corresponding error, and highlights it with the new
@code{flycheck-error-list-highlight-at-point} face.  Additionally, it highlights all
other errors at the current line with the new
@ref{7f,,flycheck-error-list-highlight} face.

@node C/C++ support,New info level messages,New error list,Flycheck 0 15
@anchor{guide/releases/flycheck-0 15 c-c-support}@anchor{1cf}
@subsubsection C/C++ support


The @ref{9f,,c/c++-clang} syntax checker for C and C++ got a bunch
of new options:


@itemize -

@item 
Set additional preprocessor definitions for syntax checking with
@ref{a4,,flycheck-clang-definitions}, corresponding to the @code{-D} option for
@code{clang}.

@item 
Include additional headers or files during syntax checking with
@ref{a6,,flycheck-clang-includes}, corresponding to the @code{-include} option for
@code{clang}.

@item 
Choose the language standard, e.g. C++98 or C++11, with
@ref{a7,,flycheck-clang-language-standard}, corresponding to the @code{-std} option
for @code{clang}.

@item 
Disable RTTI during syntax checking with @ref{aa,,flycheck-clang-no-rtti},
corresponding to the @code{-fno-rtti} option for @code{clang}.  In current Clang
versions, however, this does not cause errors or warnings when using RTTI.

@item 
Choose the standard library for syntax checking with
@ref{ab,,flycheck-clang-standard-library}, corresponding to the @code{-stdlib}
option for @code{clang}.  Currently, Clang supports @code{libstdc++} for the good old
GNU standard library, and @code{libc++} for the modern Libc++ from the LLVM project.
@end itemize

Besides, the Clang syntax checker was changed to correctly handle local include
files, e.g. @code{#include "foo.h"}.

@node New info level messages,Custom error levels,C/C++ support,Flycheck 0 15
@anchor{guide/releases/flycheck-0 15 new-info-level-messages}@anchor{1d0}
@subsubsection New @code{info} level messages


In addition to the @code{warning} and @code{error} levels, Flycheck now has a new @code{info}
level, which is intended for informational messages which provide additional
information about a specific location in the source code.  With this new level,
the semantics of error levels is as follows:


@table @asis

@item @code{error}

Definite errors which must be fixed for the source code to work correctly

@item @code{warning}

Potential errors and issues, which can be ignored, but still deserve to be
fixed

@item @code{info}

Additional information about a specific source code location, which does not
indicate an error or issue, but is still worth noting
@end table

Some syntax checkers were changed to use this new level for messages, which do
not really fit into the @code{warning} level:


@itemize -

@item 
@ref{9f,,c/c++-clang} for @code{note:} messages

@item 
@ref{115,,python-flake8} for PEP8 naming issues emitted by the
@code{pep8-naming} plugin

@item 
@ref{11a,,python-pylint} for convention level messages, e.g. naming
issues, etc.
@end itemize

The new level is already supported by the popular Solarized@footnote{https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs} and Zenburn@footnote{https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs}
themes.

@node Custom error levels,Other improvements,New info level messages,Flycheck 0 15
@anchor{guide/releases/flycheck-0 15 custom-error-levels}@anchor{1d1}@anchor{guide/releases/flycheck-0 15 id2}@anchor{1d2}
@subsubsection Custom error levels


The new @code{info} level is backed by a generic mechanism to define new error
levels, using the new function @ref{27,,flycheck-define-error-level}.  For
instance, the @code{warning} level is now defined as follows:

@example
(flycheck-define-error-level 'warning
  :overlay-category 'flycheck-warning-overlay
  :fringe-bitmap 'question-mark
  :fringe-face 'flycheck-fringe-warning)
@end example

A error level consists of a category for overlays, which defines the appearance
and priority of overlays for this level, and bitmap and face for fringe
indicators.

After defining an error level, you can use it the error patterns of a syntax
checker as usual.

@anchor{guide/releases/flycheck-0 15 other-improvements}@anchor{1d3}
@subsubsection Other improvements


Beside these important changes, there are also a number of smaller improvements:


@itemize -

@item 
Flycheck does not longer check encrypted files for obvious reasons.

@item 
The @ref{ce,,emacs-lisp-checkdoc} syntax checker does not check
@code{.dir-locals.el} anymore.

@item 
@ref{11a,,python-pylint} now parses error columns from the output of
@code{pylint}.

@item 
Spurious “flawed definition” warnings in @ref{103,,lua},
@ref{123,,rst} and @ref{e2,,go-build} were fixed.

@item 
@ref{a1,,c/c++-cppcheck} output now parses correctly when using the pure
Emacs Lisp XML parser in @code{xml.el}.

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
Nonetheless, you are advised to use Emacs with @code{libxml} support.  Most
Linux distributions ship Emacs packages with @code{libxml} support, but if you
are building your own, or use a source-based distribution such as Gentoo,
take care to enable @code{libxml} for Emacs.

@section Defining new syntax checkers


Flycheck provides the macro @ref{19,,flycheck-define-checker} to define a new
syntax checker.  The following example defines a simple syntax checker for the
popular Pylint@footnote{http://www.pylint.org/} tool for Python:

@example
(flycheck-define-checker python-pylint
  "A Python syntax and style checker using Pylint.

See URL `http://www.pylint.org/'."
  :command ("pylint"
            "--msg-template" "@{path@}:@{line@}:@{column@}:@{C@}:@{msg@} (@{msg_id@})"
            source)
  :error-patterns
  ((error line-start (file-name) ":" line ":" column ":"
          (or "E" "F") ":" (message) line-end)
   (warning line-start (file-name) ":" line ":" column ":"
            (or "W" "R") ":" (message) line-end)
   (info line-start (file-name) ":" line ":" column ":"
         "C:" (message) line-end))
  :modes python-mode)
@end example

The first argument to @ref{19,,flycheck-define-checker} is the @emph{name} of a syntax
checker, by which we can refer to this particular syntax checker.

Next comes the @emph{docstring}, which should provide a bit of information about the
syntax checker.  It's a good idea to provide a link to the homepage of the
syntax checker tool here.  You can view this docstring in Emacs with
@ref{3a,,flycheck-describe-checker} or @code{C-c ! ?}, e.g. @code{C-c ! ?
texinfo}.

Eventually we specify the @emph{properties} of the new syntax checker.  These
properties tell Flycheck when to use your new syntax checker, how to run it, and
how to parse its output:


@itemize -

@item 
The @code{:command} specifies the command Flycheck should run to check the buffer.
It's a simple list containing the executable and its arguments.

In our example we first the @code{--msg-template} option to Pylint to configure a
comprehensive and parseable output format.

Then we use the “special” @code{source} argument to pass the contents of the buffer
as input file to @code{pylint}.  Whenever it sees the @code{source} argument, Flycheck
creates a temporary file, fills it with the current contents of the buffer and
passes that file to the syntax checker.  This allows to check the real
contents of a buffer even if the buffer is not saved to disk.

@item 
The @code{:error-patterns} tell Flycheck how to parse the output of the command in
order to obtain error locations.  Each pattern has a @emph{level}, followed by @code{rx}
forms which specify a regular expression to find an error in the output of the
command.

Flycheck understands three error levels by default:  @code{error} is for critical
errors that absolutely require the user's attention (e.g. syntax errors),
@code{warning} is for issues that can be ignored, but should not (e.g. unused
variables), and @code{info} is for other messages that provide information about
the buffer, but do not immediately require action from the user.

@ref{27,,flycheck-define-error-level}; to define custom error
levels


Flycheck provides special @code{rx} forms to extract the relevant information from
each error:


@itemize -

@item 
The @code{(file-name)} and @code{(message)} forms match a sequence of any character
save new line as file name and message of the error.  Both optionally accept
further @code{rx} forms, to specify an alternative regular expression to match
the file name or the message, for instance to parse multi-line error
messages.

@item 
The @code{line} and @code{column} forms match a sequence of one or more digits as line
and column respectively of the error.
@end itemize


@subsubheading See also


@ref{1fb,,flycheck-rx-to-string}; for a list of all special @code{rx}
forms provided by Flycheck and their reference


@item 
The @code{:modes} property denotes the major modes, in which Flycheck may use this
syntax checker.  JSHint checks Javascript, so the @code{:modes} of our example
specifies Emacs' builtin Javascript Mode, and the popular 3rd-party JS2 Mode.

@anchor{dev/extending pylint}@anchor{1fd}@anchor{dev/extending finding-the-right-error-patterns}@anchor{1fe}
@subsection Finding the right error patterns


Finding the right error patterns is the hardest part of a syntax checker
definition.  For a first version, you just run the tool on a file, look at its
output and write a regular expression to match it.  @code{M-x shell} comes handy
here.

However, as you start to debug and refine your patterns, this quickly becomes
cumbersome.  Flycheck provides an easier way to test a syntax checker: Evaluate
the syntax checker definition with @code{C-M-x} and run
@ref{198,,flycheck-compile}.

@geindex flycheck-compile; Emacs Lisp command

@deffn {Command} C@w{-}c ! C@w{-}c
@anchor{dev/extending el function flycheck-compile}@anchor{198}
@deffnx {Command} M@w{-}x flycheck@w{-}compile

Run a syntax checker on the current buffer in a fresh Compilation Mode
buffer.  Prompt for a syntax checker to run.
@end deffn

This command runs the command like a normal syntax check would do, but instead
of highlighting errors within the buffer it shows a new buffer in Compilation
Mode, which contains the entire output of the command and highlights everything
that matches a pattern.

Sometimes however an output format doesn't lend itself to error patterns.  In
this case, you need to write a more sophisticated parser yourself.  See
@ref{1ff,,Parsing structured output format} for more information.

@node Trying a new syntax checker,Registering new syntax checkers,Finding the right error patterns,Defining new syntax checkers
@anchor{dev/extending trying-a-new-syntax-checker}@anchor{200}
@subsection Trying a new syntax checker


After evaluating a syntax checker definition you can try whether it works for
normal syntax checks by selecting it manually with @code{C-c ! s}
(@ref{24,,flycheck-select-checker}).  If anything breaks, you can unselect the
syntax checker again with @code{C-u C-c ! s} and fix the error without further
affecting Flycheck.

Once you have confirmed that your new syntax checker works flawlessly, you can
make it available for automatic syntax checking by registering it.

@node Registering new syntax checkers,,Trying a new syntax checker,Defining new syntax checkers
@anchor{dev/extending registering-new-syntax-checkers}@anchor{201}@anchor{dev/extending id2}@anchor{202}
@subsection Registering new syntax checkers


To register a new syntax checker for automatic syntax checking, just add it to
@ref{5e,,flycheck-checkers}:

@example
(add-to-list 'flycheck-checkers 'flycheck-jshint)
@end example

Flycheck will try all syntax checkers in this variable when checking a buffer
automatically, and check the buffer with the first syntax checker in this list
whose @code{:modes} contains the current major mode.

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
Do @strong{not} use @ref{23,,flycheck-checker} and
@ref{24,,flycheck-select-checker} to enable your own syntax checker in
Flycheck extensions.  They are reserved for @strong{user customization}.

Specifically, please do @strong{not} provide a hook function which selects the
syntax checker explicitly by assigning to @ref{23,,flycheck-checker} or by
calling @ref{24,,flycheck-select-checker}.  In other words, this is
@strong{bad}:

@example
(defun enable-my-new-syntax-checker ()
  (setq flycheck-checker 'my-new-syntax-checker)
  (flycheck-buffer))

(add-hook 'my-major-mode-hook #'enable-my-new-syntax-checker)
@end example

This circumvents the entire automatic selection of Flycheck, and prevents the
user from effectively customizing Flycheck.

Instead, just register your syntax checker in @ref{5e,,flycheck-checkers} and
let Flycheck automatically pick the best syntax checker.  In other words,
this is @strong{good}:

@example
(add-to-list 'flycheck-checkers 'my-new-syntax-checker)

@anchor{dev/extending id3}@anchor{204}@anchor{dev/extending parsing-structured-output-format}@anchor{1ff}
@subsection Parsing structured output format


If your syntax checker tool offers some structured output format as alternative
to human-readable free text, you can use an @code{:error-parser} function instead of
writing an error pattern.  For instance, JSHint@footnote{http://www.jshint.com/} offers the widely spread
Checkstyle XML output format which Flycheck supports out of the box:

@example
(flycheck-define-checker javascript-jshint
  "A JavaScript syntax and style checker using jshint.

See URL `http://www.jshint.com'."
  :command ("jshint" "--checkstyle-reporter" source)
  :error-parser flycheck-parse-checkstyle
  :modes (js-mode js2-mode js3-mode))
@end example

As you can see, there are no patterns in this definition.  Instead Flycheck
calls the function @ref{176,,flycheck-parse-checkstyle} to parse the output.
This function parses the XML to extract the errors.  It's built-in into
Flycheck, so if your tool supports Checkstyle XML, error parsing comes @strong{for
free} in Flycheck.

@anchor{dev/extending passing-options-and-configuration-files-to-syntax-checkers}@anchor{206}@anchor{dev/extending jshint}@anchor{207}
@subsection Passing options and configuration files to syntax checkers


Many linting tools provide a rich set of options to configure their analysis.
Flycheck makes it to define proper Emacs options and map them to options of
commands.

For instance, the Rubocop@footnote{https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop} tool checks Ruby for semantic and stylistic issues.
Since style is mainly a matter of taste, it has a special linting mode in which
all stylistic checks are disabled (error patterns omitted for readability):

@example
(flycheck-define-checker ruby-rubocop
  "A Ruby syntax and style checker using the RuboCop tool.

See URL `http://batsov.com/rubocop/'."
  :command ("rubocop" "--format" "emacs"
            (option-flag "--lint" flycheck-rubocop-lint-only)
            source)
  :error-patterns ...
  :modes (ruby-mode))
@end example

Note the special @code{option-flag} argument, which splices the value of the boolean
Emacs option @code{flycheck-rubocop-lint-only} into the command: If the variable is
non-nil, Flycheck adds the @code{--lint} option to the final command line, other
Flycheck omits the entire argument.

Flycheck also supports other special @code{option-} arguments for plain values or
lists of values.


@subsubheading See also


flycheck-substitute-argument; for a list of all special @code{option-}
arguments


Flycheck also provides a convenience macro @ref{208,,flycheck-def-option-var} to
declare these options:

@example
(flycheck-def-option-var flycheck-rubocop-lint-only nil ruby-rubocop
  "Whether to only report code issues in Rubocop.

When non-nil, only report code issues in Rubocop, via `--lint'.
Otherwise report style issues as well."
  :safe #'booleanp
  :type 'boolean)
@end example

Essentially, this macro is just a wrapper around the built-in @code{defcustom}, which
additionally keeps track of the syntax checker the option belongs to, and adds
the option to the appropriate custom group.  You can pass arbitrary custom
keywords to this macro as we did in this example: @code{:type} marks this option as
boolean flag, and @code{:safe} allows the use as file-local variable, if the value is
boolean.

By a similar mechanism you can also pass paths to configuration files to a
syntax checker tool.  The aforementioned Pylint@footnote{http://www.pylint.org/} reads a configuration file
for instance:

@example
(flycheck-define-checker python-pylint
  "A Python syntax and style checker using Pylint.

This syntax checker requires Pylint 1.0 or newer.

See URL `http://www.pylint.org/'."
  ;; -r n disables the scoring report
  :command ("pylint" "-r" "n"
            "--msg-template" "@{path@}:@{line@}:@{column@}:@{C@}:@{msg@} (@{msg_id@})"
            (config-file "--rcfile" flycheck-pylintrc)
            source)
  :error-patterns ...
  :modes python-mode)
@end example

The special @code{config-file} argument passes a configuration file from
@code{flycheck-pylintrc} to @code{pylint}, if the value of the variable is non-nil.

Flycheck provides a sophisticated logic to find an appropriate configuration
file.  See @ref{6b,,Syntax checker configuration files} and
@ref{209,,Configuration files for command syntax checkers} for details.

@subsection Controlling the use of a syntax checker


If you need more control about when a syntax checker is used for syntax
checking, you can supply a custom @code{:predicate} function.  Consider the following
syntax checker for Zsh scripts in Sh Mode:

@example
(flycheck-define-checker sh-zsh
  "A Zsh syntax checker using the Zsh shell.

See URL `http://www.zsh.org/'."
  :command ("zsh" "-n" "-d" "-f" source)
  :error-patterns
  ((error line-start (file-name) ":" line ": " (message) line-end))
  :modes sh-mode
  :predicate (lambda () (eq sh-shell 'zsh)))
@end example

Sh Mode also supports Bash and other shells besides Zsh, so we additionally
provide a @code{:predicate} that checks whether the current buffer has the right
shell.

You can even omit @code{:modes} and only use a predicate to determine whether a
syntax checker is applicable for the current buffer.

@node Applying more than one syntax checker,,Controlling the use of a syntax checker,Advanced syntax checker definitions
@anchor{dev/extending applying-more-than-one-syntax-checker}@anchor{20c}
@subsection Applying more than one syntax checker


Frequently, we would like to use multiple syntax checkers in a buffer.  For
instance, we might want to check the syntax of a script with @code{sh-zsh} from the
previous section, and then use Shellcheck@footnote{https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/} to check for questionable code such
as unquoted variable expansions, if there are no syntax errors.  Flycheck
supports this scenario by @emph{chaining} syntax checkers.

Suppose we defined a syntax checker for Shellcheck called @code{sh-shellcheck} as
follows:

@example
(flycheck-define-checker sh-shellcheck
  "A shell script syntax and style checker using Shellcheck.

See URL `https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/'."
  :command ("shellcheck" "-f" "checkstyle"
            "-s" (eval (symbol-name sh-shell))
            source)
  :modes sh-mode
  :error-parser flycheck-parse-checkstyle)
@end example

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
Note how we use the special @code{eval} argument to put the result of an arbitrary
Emacs Lisp expression into the command line of @code{shellcheck}, in order to tell
Shellcheck what shell the script is written for.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

We can now arrange for this syntax checker to be used after @code{sh-zsh} with
@ref{20d,,flycheck-add-next-checker}:

@example
(flycheck-add-next-checker 'sh-zsh '(warning . sh-shellcheck))
@end example

The first item of the cons cell in the second argument is the @emph{maximum error
level} in the buffer, for which @code{sh-shellcheck} is still applicable.  With
@code{warning} Flycheck will run @code{sh-shellcheck} after @code{sh-zsh} if there are
@code{warning} or @code{info} level errors from @code{sh-zsh}, but not if there are any errors
with level @code{error}, such as syntax errors.

Flycheck will only use a chained syntax checker if it is registered in
@ref{5e,,flycheck-checkers}, so we need to @ref{201,,register our new syntax checker}:

@example
(add-to-list 'flycheck-checkers 'sh-shellcheck 'append)
@end example

Note that unlike before we @strong{append} the new syntax checker at the end of
@code{flycheck-checkers}.  This ensures that Flycheck does not try @code{sh-shellcheck}
@emph{before} @code{sh-zsh}.

@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
Make sure to append chained syntax checkers to @ref{5e,,flycheck-checkers}.

Flycheck tries all syntax checkers in this list in @strong{order of appearance},
so if you add your new chained syntax checker at the beginning, it will
likely be used right away, before any prior syntax checkers.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

You also can specify chained syntax checkers directly in
@ref{19,,flycheck-define-checker} with the @code{:next-checkers} property.  Instead of
calling @ref{20d,,flycheck-add-next-checker}, we could also have added this
property to the definition of @code{sh-zsh}:

@example
(flycheck-define-checker sh-zsh
  "A Zsh syntax checker using the Zsh shell.

See URL `http://www.zsh.org/'."
  :command ("zsh" "-n" "-d" "-f" source)
  :error-patterns ...
  :modes sh-mode
  :predicate (lambda () (eq sh-shell 'zsh))
  :next-checkers ((warning . sh-shellcheck)))
@end example

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
If you control the definition of both syntax checkers, this style is
@strong{preferable} to @ref{20d,,flycheck-add-next-checker}.  Use this function
only if you cannot change the definition of the prior syntax checker.

@item 
Clear error information from previous syntax checks.

@item 
Select a @ref{53,,suitable syntax checker}.

@item 
Run the syntax checker.

@item 
Parse the output of the tool, and report all errors and warnings, via

@item 
If the buffer can be checked with another syntax checker, continue from step

@section Generic syntax checkers


Generic syntax checkers are the most basic syntax checkers in Flycheck.  These
syntax checkers use an Emacs Lisp function to check the current buffer.

@deffn {Function} flycheck@w{-}define@w{-}generic@w{-}checker symbol docstring &rest  properties

@format
Define SYMBOL as generic syntax checker.

Any syntax checker defined with this macro is eligible for manual
syntax checker selection with @ref{24,,`flycheck-select-checker'}.  To make
the new syntax checker available for automatic selection, it must
be registered in @ref{5e,,`flycheck-checkers'}.

DOCSTRING is the documentation of the syntax checker, for
@ref{3a,,`flycheck-describe-checker'}.  The following PROPERTIES constitute
a generic syntax checker.  Unless otherwise noted, all properties
are mandatory.

@code{:start FUNCTION}
     A function to start the syntax checker.

     FUNCTION shall take two arguments and return a context
     object if the checker is started successfully.  Otherwise it
     shall signal an error.

     The first argument is the syntax checker being started.  The
     second is a callback function to report state changes to
     Flycheck.  The callback takes two arguments STATUS DATA,
     where STATUS is a symbol denoting the syntax checker status
     and DATA an optional argument with additional data for the
     status report.  See @code{`flycheck-report-buffer-checker-status'}
     for more information about STATUS and DATA.

     FUNCTION may be synchronous or asynchronous, i.e. it may
     call the given callback either immediately, or at some later
     point (e.g. from a process sentinel).

     A syntax checker _must_ call CALLBACK at least once with a
     STATUS that finishes the current syntax checker.  Otherwise
     Flycheck gets stuck at the current syntax check with this
     syntax checker.

     The context object returned by FUNCTION is passed to
     @code{`:interrupt'}.

@code{:interrupt FUNCTION}
     A function to interrupt the syntax check.

     FUNCTION is called with the syntax checker and the context
     object returned by the @code{`:start'} function and shall try to
     interrupt the syntax check.  The context may be nil, if the
     syntax check is interrupted before actually started.
     FUNCTION should handle this situation.

     If it cannot interrupt the syntax check, it may either
     signal an error or silently ignore the attempt to interrupt
     the syntax checker, depending on the severity of the
     situation.

     If interrupting the syntax check failed, Flycheck will let
     the syntax check continue, but ignore any status reports.
     Notably, it won't highlight any errors reported by the
     syntax check in the buffer.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, Flycheck won't
     attempt to interrupt syntax checks wit this syntax checker,
     and simply ignore their results.

@code{:print-doc FUNCTION}
     A function to print additional documentation into the Help
     buffer of this checker.

     FUNCTION is called when creating the Help buffer for the
     syntax checker, with the syntax checker as single argument,
     after printing the name of the syntax checker and its modes
     and predicate, but before printing DOCSTRING.  It may insert
     additional documentation into the current buffer.

     The call occurs within @code{`with-help-window'}.  Hence
     @code{`standard-output'} points to the current buffer, so you may
     use @code{`princ'} and friends to add content.  Also, the current
     buffer is put into Help mode afterwards, which automatically
     turns symbols into references, if possible.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, no additional
     documentation is printed for this syntax checker.

:verify FUNCTION
     A function to verify the checker for the current buffer.

     FUNCTION is called with the syntax checker as single
     argument, and shall return a list of
     @code{`flycheck-verification-result'} objects indicating whether
     the syntax checker could be used in the current buffer, and
     highlighting potential setup problems.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, no additional
     verification occurs for this syntax checker.  It is however
     absolutely recommended that you add a @code{`:verify'} function to
     your syntax checker, because it will help users to spot
     potential setup problems.

@code{:modes MODES}
     A major mode symbol or a list thereof, denoting major modes
     to use this syntax checker in.

     If given this syntax checker is only used in buffers whose
     @code{`major-mode'} is @code{`eq'} to any mode in MODES.

     If @code{`:predicate'} is also given, the syntax checker will only
     be used in buffers for which the @code{`:predicate'} returns
     non-nil.

     This property is optional, however at least one of @code{`:modes'}
     or @code{`:predicate'} must be given.

@code{:predicate FUNCTION}
     A function to determine whether to use the syntax checker in
     the current buffer.

     FUNCTION is called without arguments and shall return
     non-nil if this syntax checker shall be used to check the
     current buffer.  Otherwise it shall return nil.

     If @code{`:modes'} is also given, FUNCTION is only called in
     matching major modes.

     This property is optional, however at least one of @code{`:modes'}
     or @code{`:predicate'} must be given.

@code{:error-filter FUNCTION}
     A function to filter the errors returned by this checker.

     FUNCTION is called with the list of @code{`flycheck-error'} objects
     returned by the syntax checker and shall return another list
     of @code{`flycheck-error'} objects, which is considered the final
     result of this syntax checker.

     FUNCTION is free to add, remove or modify errors, whether in
     place or by copying.

     This property is optional.  The default filter is
     @code{`identity'}.

@code{:next-checkers NEXT-CHECKERS}
     A list denoting syntax checkers to apply after this syntax
     checker, in what we call "chaining" of syntax checkers.

     Each ITEM is a cons cell @code{(LEVEL . CHECKER)}.  CHECKER is a
     syntax checker to run after this syntax checker.  LEVEL is
     an error level.  CHECKER will only be used if there are no
     current errors of at least LEVEL.  LEVEL may also be t, in
     which case CHECKER is used regardless of the current errors.

     ITEM may also be a syntax checker symbol, which is
     equivalent to @code{(t . ITEM)}.

     Flycheck tries all items in order of declaration, and uses
     the first whose LEVEL matches and whose CHECKER is
     registered and can be used for the current buffer.

     This feature is typically used to apply more than one syntax
     checker to a buffer.  For instance, you might first use a
     compiler to check a buffer for syntax and type errors, and
     then run a linting tool that checks for insecure code, or
     questionable style.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, it defaults to the
     nil, i.e. no other syntax checkers are applied after this
     syntax checker.

Signal an error, if any property has an invalid value.

@subsection Status callback protocol


The @code{callback} argument to the @code{:start} function of a syntax checker defined
with @ref{1b,,flycheck-define-generic-checker} is a function taking two
arguments:

@geindex status-callback; Emacs Lisp function
@anchor{dev/api el function status-callback}@anchor{223}
@deffn {Function} status@w{-}callback status &optional  data

@code{status} is one of the following symbols, denoting the status being reported:


@table @asis

@item @code{errored} (@emph{finishing})

The syntax checker has errored.  @code{data} is an optional error message as
string.

@item @code{interrupted} (@emph{finishing})

The syntax checker was interrupted.  @code{data} is ignored in this case.

@item @code{finished} (@emph{finishing})

The syntax checker has finished to check the buffer and reported some
errors.  DATA is the list of @ref{165,,flycheck-error} objects reported
by the syntax check.

@item @code{suspicious}

The syntax checker encountered some suspicious state (like a potential
fault in the syntax checker definition), which the user needs to be
informed about.
@end table

A @emph{finishing} @code{status} symbol finishes the current syntax check, and allows
Flycheck to conduct further syntax checks.  A syntax checker @strong{must} call
the callback at least once with a @emph{finishing} @code{status} symbol.

Failure to call the callback will cause Flycheck to get stuck at the

@section Command syntax checkers


Command syntax checkers are a specialised variant of generic syntax checkers
which use an external command to check the contents of the current buffer.  To
define a new command syntax checker, use
@ref{173,,flycheck-define-command-checker}:

@geindex flycheck-define-command-checker; Emacs Lisp function
@anchor{dev/api el function flycheck-define-command-checker}@anchor{173}
@deffn {Function} flycheck@w{-}define@w{-}command@w{-}checker symbol docstring &rest  properties

@format
Define SYMBOL as syntax checker which runs a command.

Define SYMBOL as generic syntax checker via
@ref{1b,,`flycheck-define-generic-checker'}, which uses an external command
to check the buffer.  SYMBOL and DOCSTRING are the same as for
@ref{1b,,`flycheck-define-generic-checker'}.

In addition to the properties understood by
@ref{1b,,`flycheck-define-generic-checker'}, the following PROPERTIES
constitute a command syntax checker.  Unless otherwise noted, all
properties are mandatory.  Note that the default @code{`:error-filter'}
of command checkers is @ref{227,,`flycheck-sanitize-errors'}.

@code{:command COMMAND}
     The command to run for syntax checking.

     COMMAND is a list of the form @code{(EXECUTABLE [ARG ...])}.

     EXECUTABLE is a string with the executable of this syntax
     checker.  It can be overridden with the variable
     @code{`flycheck-SYMBOL-executable'}.  Note that this variable is
     NOT implicitly defined by this function.  Use
     @ref{22e,,`flycheck-def-executable-var'} to define this variable.

     Each ARG is an argument to the executable, either as string,
     or as special symbol or form for
     @ref{1fc,,`flycheck-substitute-argument'}, which see.

@code{:error-patterns PATTERNS}
     A list of patterns to parse the output of the @code{`:command'}.

     Each ITEM in PATTERNS is a list @code{(LEVEL SEXP ...)}, where
     LEVEL is a Flycheck error level (see
     @ref{27,,`flycheck-define-error-level'}), followed by one or more RX
     @code{`SEXP'}s which parse an error of that level and extract line,
     column, file name and the message.

     See @code{`rx'} for general information about RX, and
     @ref{1fb,,`flycheck-rx-to-string'} for some special RX forms provided
     by Flycheck.

     All patterns are applied in the order of declaration to the
     whole output of the syntax checker.  Output already matched
     by a pattern will not be matched by subsequent patterns.  In
     other words, the first pattern wins.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, however, an
     @code{`:error-parser'} is mandatory.

@code{:error-parser FUNCTION}
     A function to parse errors with.

     The function shall accept three arguments OUTPUT CHECKER
     BUFFER.  OUTPUT is the syntax checker output as string,
     CHECKER the syntax checker that was used, and BUFFER a
     buffer object representing the checked buffer.  The function
     must return a list of @code{`flycheck-error'} objects parsed from
     OUTPUT.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, it defaults to
     @ref{22f,,`flycheck-parse-with-patterns'}.  In this case,
     @code{`:error-patterns'} is mandatory.

Note that you may not give @code{`:start'}, @code{`:interrupt'}, and
@code{`:print-doc'} for a command checker.  You can give a custom
@code{`:verify'} function, but you should take care to call
@code{`flycheck-verify-command-checker'} in a custom @code{`:verify'}
function.
@end format
@end deffn

Each command checker uses an accompanying variable to override the executable,
which you can define with @ref{22e,,flycheck-def-executable-var}:

@geindex flycheck-def-executable-var; Emacs Lisp macro
@anchor{dev/api el function flycheck-def-executable-var}@anchor{22e}
@deffn {Macro} flycheck@w{-}def@w{-}executable@w{-}var checker default-executable

@format
Define the executable variable for CHECKER.

DEFAULT-EXECUTABLE is the default executable.  It is only used in
the docstring of the variable.

The variable is defined with @code{`defcustom'} in the
@code{`flycheck-executables'} group.  It's also defined to be risky as
file-local variable, to avoid arbitrary executables being used
for syntax checking.
@end format
@end deffn

Since command syntax checkers are by far the most common kind of syntax
checkers, Flycheck provides a convenience macro @ref{19,,flycheck-define-checker}
which wraps up @ref{173,,flycheck-define-command-checker} and
@ref{22e,,flycheck-def-executable-var} into a single macro, and reduces syntactic
clutter by allowing unquoted arguments:

@geindex flycheck-define-checker; Emacs Lisp macro
@anchor{dev/api el function flycheck-define-checker}@anchor{19}
@deffn {Macro} flycheck@w{-}define@w{-}checker symbol docstring &rest  properties

@format
Define SYMBOL as command syntax checker with DOCSTRING and PROPERTIES.

Like @ref{173,,`flycheck-define-command-checker'}, but PROPERTIES must not
be quoted.  Also, implicitly define the executable variable for
SYMBOL with @ref{22e,,`flycheck-def-executable-var'}.

@subsection Command arguments


The arguments passed to the external command of a command syntax checker are
subject to substitution with @ref{1fc,,flycheck-substitute-argument}, which
replaces special symbols and forms with strings for consumption by the external
command:

@geindex flycheck-substitute-argument; Emacs Lisp function
@anchor{dev/api el function flycheck-substitute-argument}@anchor{1fc}
@deffn {Function} flycheck@w{-}substitute@w{-}argument arg checker

@format
Substitute ARG for CHECKER.

Return a list of real arguments for the executable of CHECKER,
substituted for the symbolic argument ARG.  Single arguments,
e.g. if ARG is a literal strings, are wrapped in a list.

ARG may be one of the following forms:

STRING
     Return ARG unchanged.

@code{`source'}, @code{`source-inplace'}
     Create a temporary file to check and return its path.  With
     @code{`source-inplace'} create the temporary file in the same
     directory as the original file.  The value of
     @ref{5b,,`flycheck-temp-prefix'} is used as prefix of the file name.

     With @code{`source'}, try to retain the non-directory component of
     the buffer's file name in the temporary file.

     @code{`source'} is the preferred way to pass the input file to a
     syntax checker.  @code{`source-inplace'} should only be used if the
     syntax checker needs other files from the source directory,
     such as include files in C.

@code{`source-original'}
     Return the path of the actual file to check, or an empty
     string if the buffer has no file name.

     Note that the contents of the file may not be up to date
     with the contents of the buffer to check.  Do not use this
     as primary input to a checker, unless absolutely necessary.

     When using this symbol as primary input to the syntax
     checker, add @ref{225,,`flycheck-buffer-saved-p'} to the @code{`:predicate'}.

@code{`temporary-directory'}
     Create a unique temporary directory and return its path.

@code{`temporary-file-name'}
     Return a unique temporary filename.  The file is *not*
     created.

     To ignore the output of syntax checkers, try @code{`null-device'}
     first.

@code{`null-device'}
     Return the value of @code{`null-device'}, i.e the system null
     device.

     Use this option to ignore the output of a syntax checker.
     If the syntax checker cannot handle the null device, or
     won't write to an existing file, try @code{`temporary-file-name'}
     instead.

@code{(config-file OPTION VARIABLE [PREPEND-FN])}
     Search the configuration file bound to VARIABLE with
     @ref{231,,`flycheck-locate-config-file'} and return a list of arguments
     that pass this configuration file to the syntax checker, or
     nil if the configuration file was not found.

     PREPEND-FN is called with the OPTION and the located
     configuration file, and should return OPTION prepended
     before the file, either a string or as list.  If omitted,
     PREPEND-FN defaults to @code{`list'}.

@code{(option OPTION VARIABLE [PREPEND-FN [FILTER]])}
     Retrieve the value of VARIABLE and return a list of
     arguments that pass this value as value for OPTION to the
     syntax checker.

     PREPEND-FN is called with the OPTION and the value of
     VARIABLE, and should return OPTION prepended before the
     file, either a string or as list.  If omitted, PREPEND-FN
     defaults to @code{`list'}.

     FILTER is an optional function to be applied to the value of
     VARIABLE before prepending.  This function must return nil
     or a string.  In the former case, return nil.  In the latter
     case, return a list of arguments as described above.

@code{(option-list OPTION VARIABLE [PREPEND-FN [FILTER]])}
     Retrieve the value of VARIABLE, which must be a list,
     and prepend OPTION before each item in this list, using
     PREPEND-FN.

     PREPEND-FN is called with the OPTION and each item of the
     list as second argument, and should return OPTION prepended
     before the item, either as string or as list.  If omitted,
     PREPEND-FN defaults to @code{`list'}.

     FILTER is an optional function to be applied to each item in
     the list before prepending OPTION.  It shall return the
     option value for each item as string, or nil, if the item is
     to be ignored.

@code{(option-flag OPTION VARIABLE)}
     Retrieve the value of VARIABLE and return OPTION, if the
     value is non-nil.  Otherwise return nil.

@code{(eval FORM)}
     Return the result of evaluating FORM in the buffer to be
     checked.  FORM must either return a string or a list of
     strings, or nil to indicate that nothing should be
     substituted for CELL.  For all other return types, signal an
     error

     _No_ further substitutions are performed, neither in FORM
     before it is evaluated, nor in the result of evaluating
     FORM.

In all other cases, signal an error.

Note that substitution is *not* recursive.  No symbols or cells
are substituted within the body of cells!

@deffn {Function} flycheck@w{-}option@w{-}comma@w{-}separated@w{-}list value &optional  separator filter

@format
Convert VALUE into a list separated by SEPARATOR.

SEPARATOR is a string to separate items in VALUE, defaulting to
",".  FILTER is an optional function, which takes a single
argument and returns either a string or nil.

If VALUE is a list, apply FILTER to each item in VALUE, remove
all nil items, and return a single string of all remaining items
separated by SEPARATOR.

Otherwise, apply FILTER to VALUE and return the result.
SEPARATOR is ignored in this case.

@subsection Configuration files for command syntax checkers


Additionally, command syntax checkers can pass configuration files to external
commands.

@geindex flycheck-def-config-file-var; Emacs Lisp macro
@anchor{dev/api el function flycheck-def-config-file-var}@anchor{237}
@deffn {Macro} flycheck@w{-}def@w{-}config@w{-}file@w{-}var symbol checker &optional  file-name &rest  custom-args

@format
Define SYMBOL as config file variable for CHECKER, with default FILE-NAME.

SYMBOL is declared as customizable variable using @code{`defcustom'}, to
provide a configuration file for the given syntax CHECKER.
CUSTOM-ARGS are forwarded to @code{`defcustom'}.

FILE-NAME is the initial value of the new variable.  If omitted,
the default value is nil.

Use this together with the @code{`config-file'} form in the @code{`:command'}
argument to @ref{19,,`flycheck-define-checker'}.
@end format
@end deffn

Flycheck tries to find an appropriate file based on the value of configuration
file variables, and substitutes the path to that file into the external command.

@geindex flycheck-locate-config-file; Emacs Lisp function
@anchor{dev/api el function flycheck-locate-config-file}@anchor{231}
@deffn {Function} flycheck@w{-}locate@w{-}config@w{-}file filename checker

@format
Locate the configuration file FILENAME for CHECKER.

Locate the configuration file using
@ref{6d,,`flycheck-locate-config-file-functions'}.

Return the absolute path of the configuration file, or nil if no
configuration file was found.

@anchor{dev/api error-parsing-with-regular-expressions}@anchor{238}
@subsection Error parsing with regular expressions


Normally, command syntax checkers use regular expressions to extract errors from
the output.  For simplicity and readability, Flycheck uses RX expressions
instead of standard regular expressions, and provides some custom RX forms for
frequent patterns, implemented by @ref{1fb,,flycheck-rx-to-string}:

@geindex flycheck-rx-to-string; Emacs Lisp function
@anchor{dev/api el function flycheck-rx-to-string}@anchor{1fb}
@deffn {Function} flycheck@w{-}rx@w{-}to@w{-}string form &optional  no-group

@format
Like @code{`rx-to-string'} for FORM, but with special keywords:

@code{`line'}
     matches the line number.

@code{`column'}
     matches the column number.

@code{(file-name SEXP ...)}
     matches the file name.  SEXP describes the file name.  If no
     SEXP is given, use a default body of @code{(minimal-match
     (one-or-more not-newline))}.

@code{(message SEXP ...)}
     matches the message. SEXP constitutes the body of the message.  If no SEXP
     is given, use a default body of @code{(one-or-more not-newline)}.

@code{(id SEXP ...)}
     matches an error ID.  SEXP describes the ID.

NO-GROUP is passed to @code{`rx-to-string'}.
@end format
@end deffn

Internally, error parsing with regular expressions is implemented with a special
error parser:

@geindex flycheck-parse-with-patterns; Emacs Lisp function
@anchor{dev/api el function flycheck-parse-with-patterns}@anchor{22f}
@deffn {Function} flycheck@w{-}parse@w{-}with@w{-}patterns output checker buffer

@format
Parse OUTPUT from CHECKER with error patterns.

Uses the error patterns of CHECKER to tokenize the output and
tries to parse each error token with all patterns, in the order
of declaration.  Hence an error is never matched twice by two
different patterns.  The pattern declared first always wins.

_BUFFER is ignored.

Return a list of parsed errors and warnings (as @code{`flycheck-error'}
objects).
@end format
@end deffn

@node Error parsers,,Error parsing with regular expressions,Command syntax checkers
@anchor{dev/api error-parsers}@anchor{239}@anchor{dev/api api-error-parsers}@anchor{205}
@subsection Error parsers


Alternatively, command syntax checkers can use custom functions to parse errors
from the command output.  Flycheck provides some built-in error parsers for
standard output formats:

@geindex flycheck-parse-checkstyle; Emacs Lisp function
@anchor{dev/api el function flycheck-parse-checkstyle}@anchor{176}
@deffn {Function} flycheck@w{-}parse@w{-}checkstyle output checker buffer

@format
Parse Checkstyle errors from OUTPUT.

Parse Checkstyle-like XML output.  Use this error parser for
checkers that have an option to output errors in this format.

See URL `http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/'@footnote{http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/} for information
about Checkstyle.
@end format
@end deffn

You can also write your own error parsers.  An error parser is a function with
the following signature:

@geindex flycheck-error-parser; Emacs Lisp function
@anchor{dev/api el function flycheck-error-parser}@anchor{23a}
@deffn {Function} flycheck@w{-}error@w{-}parser output checker buffer

@code{output} is the output of the command as string.  @code{checker} is the syntax
checker from which the output comes, and @code{buffer} is the buffer that was
checked.
@end deffn

The following functions can aid you in writing custom parsers:

@geindex flycheck-parse-xml-string; Emacs Lisp function
@anchor{dev/api el function flycheck-parse-xml-string}@anchor{23b}
@deffn {Function} flycheck@w{-}parse@w{-}xml@w{-}string xml

@format
Parse an XML string.

Return the document tree parsed from XML in the form @code{(ROOT ATTRS
BODY...)}.  ROOT is a symbol identifying the name of the root
element.  ATTRS is an alist of the attributes of the root node.
BODY is zero or more body elements, either as strings (in case of
text nodes) or as XML nodes, in the same for as the root node.

@geindex flycheck-error-column; Emacs Lisp slot
@anchor{dev/api el function flycheck-error-column}@anchor{240}
@deffn {Slot} column

An @emph{optional} integer providing the column the error refers to.

If this attribute is @code{nil}, Flycheck will assume that the error refers to
the whole line.

@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
For compatibility with external programs and @strong{unlike} Emacs itself
(e.g. in Compile Mode), Flycheck uses 1-based columns, not 0-based: The
first character on a line is column 1.

This is the format used by most external programs, but occasionally a
program tries to proactively adapt to Emacs' convention, and outputs
0-based columns.  In this case, you need to adapt the column numbers
for Flycheck, via @ref{228,,flycheck-increment-error-columns} as
@code{:error-filter}.

@deffn {Function} flycheck@w{-}error@w{-}new@w{-}at line column &optional  level message &key                checker id filename buffer

Create a new Flycheck error at the given @var{line} and @var{column}.

@var{line} and @var{column} refer to the @ref{23f,,line} and
@ref{240,,column} of the new error.  The optional @var{level} and
@var{message} arguments fill the @ref{242,,level} and cl-slot:@code{message}
slots respectively.

@var{checker}, @var{id}, @var{filename} and @var{buffer} are keyword
arguments, for @ref{164,,checker}, @ref{175,,id}, @ref{23e,,filename} and
@ref{163,,buffer} respectively.  @var{buffer} defaults to the current

Flycheck provides three built-in error levels:


@table @asis

@item @code{error}

Severe errors which cannot be ignored

@item @code{warning}

Potential errors which can be ignored

@item @code{info}

Informational annotations
@end table

You can define new error levels with @ref{27,,flycheck-define-error-level}:

@geindex flycheck-define-error-level; Emacs Lisp function
@anchor{dev/api el function flycheck-define-error-level}@anchor{27}
@deffn {Function} flycheck@w{-}define@w{-}error@w{-}level level &rest  properties

@format
Define a new error LEVEL with PROPERTIES.

The following PROPERTIES constitute an error level:

@code{:severity SEVERITY}
     A number denoting the severity of this level.  The higher
     the number, the more severe is this level compared to other
     levels.  Defaults to 0.

     The severity is used by @ref{24c,,`flycheck-error-level-<'} to
     determine the ordering of errors according to their levels.

@code{:overlay-category CATEGORY}
     A symbol denoting the overlay category to use for error
     highlight overlays for this level.  See Info
     node @ref{Overlay Properties,,,elisp} for more information about
     overlay categories.

     A category for an error level overlay should at least define
     the @code{`face'} property, for error highlighting.  Other useful
     properties for error level categories are @code{`priority'} to
     influence the stacking of multiple error level overlays, and
     @code{`help-echo'} to define a default error messages for errors
     without messages.

@code{:fringe-bitmap BITMAP}
     A fringe bitmap symbol denoting the bitmap to use for fringe
     indicators for this level.  See Info node @ref{Fringe Bitmaps,,,elisp} for more information about fringe bitmaps,
     including a list of built-in fringe bitmaps.

@code{:fringe-face FACE}
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for fringe indicators
     for this level.

@code{:error-list-face FACE}
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for messages of this
     level in the error list.  See @ref{4b,,`flycheck-list-errors'}.

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
Test skipping

ERT in Emacs 24.3 and earlier does not support skipped tests.
For these versions, @code{flycheck-ert} provides limited support for skipped
tests by marking them as expected to fail.

@section Loading and initializing


The ERT API is provided by the @code{flycheck-ert} library, which is part of the
Flycheck package.  If the Flycheck package is installed (see
@ref{31,,Installation}), you can load the ERT API with:

@example
(require 'flycheck-ert)
@end example

This will also load the @code{ert} and @code{flycheck} libraries.

Flycheck ERT supports test resources (see @ref{25c,,Accessing test resources}).  For this
feature, you need to initialize Flycheck ERT with a resource directory by
calling @ref{25d,,flycheck-ert-initialize}:

@geindex flycheck-ert-initialize; Emacs Lisp function

@section Defining test cases


In addition to the standard @code{ert-deftest} from ERT, this library provides
macros for specialized test case definitions:

@geindex flycheck-ert-def-checker-test; Emacs Lisp macro
@anchor{dev/test-api el function flycheck-ert-def-checker-test}@anchor{270}
@deffn {Macro} flycheck@w{-}ert@w{-}def@w{-}checker@w{-}test checker language name &rest  keys-and-body

@format
Define a test case for a syntax CHECKER for LANGUAGE.

CHECKER is a symbol or a list of symbols denoting syntax checkers
being tested by the test.  The test case is skipped, if any of
these checkers cannot be used.  LANGUAGE is a symbol or a list of
symbols denoting the programming languages supported by the
syntax checkers.  This is currently only used for tagging the
test appropriately.

NAME is a symbol denoting the local name of the test.  The test
itself is ultimately named
@code{`flycheck-define-checker/CHECKER/NAME'}.  If CHECKER is a list,
the first checker in the list is used for naming the test.

Optionally, the keyword arguments @code{`:tags'} and @code{`:expected-result'}
may be given.  They have the same meaning as in @code{`ert-deftest.'},
and are added to the tags and result expectations set up by this
macro.

The remaining forms denote the body of the test case, including
assertions and setup code.

buffer.  Each error is given as a list of arguments to
@ref{243,,`flycheck-error-new-at'}.

If ERRORS are omitted, test that there are no errors at all in
the current buffer.

With ERRORS, test that each error in ERRORS is present in the
current buffer, and that the number of errors in the current
buffer is equal to the number of given ERRORS.  In other words,
check that the buffer has all ERRORS, and no other errors.

@deffn {Function} flycheck@w{-}ert@w{-}should@w{-}syntax@w{-}check resource-file modes &rest  errors

@format
Test a syntax check in RESOURCE-FILE with MODES.

RESOURCE-FILE is the file to check.  MODES is a single major mode
symbol or a list thereof, specifying the major modes to syntax
check with.  If more than one major mode is specified, the test
is run for each mode separately, so if you give three major
modes, the entire test will run three times.  ERRORS is the list
of expected errors, as in @ref{278,,`flycheck-ert-should-errors'}.  If
omitted, the syntax check must not emit any errors.  The errors
are cleared after each test.

The syntax checker is selected via standard syntax checker
selection.  To test a specific checker, you need to set
@ref{23,,`flycheck-checker'} or @ref{5f,,`flycheck-disabled-checkers'} accordingly
before using this predicate, depending on whether you want to use
manual or automatic checker selection.

During the syntax check, configuration files of syntax checkers
are also searched in the @code{`config-files'} sub-directory of the
resource directory.

@subsection Commit messages


Write commit messages according to Tim Pope's guidelines@footnote{http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html}. In short:


@itemize -

@item 
Start with a capitalized, short (50 characters or less) summary, followed by a
blank line.

@item 
If necessary, add one or more paragraphs with details, wrapped at 72
characters.

@item 
Use present tense and write in the imperative: “Fix bug”, not “fixed bug” or
“fixes bug”.

@item 
Separate paragraphs by blank lines.

@item 
Do @emph{not} use special markup (e.g. Markdown).  Commit messages are plain text.
You may use @code{*emphasis*} or @code{_underline_} though, following conventions
established on mailing lists.
@end itemize

This is a model commit message:

@example
Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
or "Fixes bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated
by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

- Use a hanging indent
@end example

Git Commit Mode@footnote{https://github.com/magit/git-modes/} and Magit@footnote{https://github.com/magit/magit/} provide a major mode for Git commit messages,

Flycheck comes with a large unit test suite, which tests all syntax checkers and
large parts of Flychecks internal API and interactive commands.

This document explains how to use this test suite.

@section Test suite layout


The library @code{flycheck-ert.el} provides many extensions to ERT, generic ones as
well as specific utilities for testing Flycheck code and syntax checkers.  You
may use this library to write test cases for your own Flycheck extensions:  It
is part of the Flycheck package.

All test code is contained in the @code{test/} sub-directory, which has the following
contents:


@itemize -

@item 
@code{flycheck-test.el}: The actual unit test suite, that is, the test cases plus
some local utility functions and macros.

@item 
@code{resources/}: Resource files used by the test suite, including example code
in various programming languages to test syntax checkers.

@item 
@code{run.el}: A simple test runner for non-interactive use, which reads ERT
selectors from the command line and runs all matching tests.
@end itemize

@node Test running,Virtual test environment,Test suite layout,Testing Flycheck
@anchor{contrib/testing test-running}@anchor{289}@anchor{contrib/testing id1}@anchor{28a}
@section Test running


First install Emacs Lisp dependencies using Cask@footnote{http://cask.readthedocs.org}:

@example
$ make deps
@end example

Then install the syntax checkers that you'd like to test:

@example
$ brew install go
$ pip install --user pylint
$ npm install --global coffee coffee-lint jshint
$ cabal install hlint shellcheck
@end example

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
If you'd like to keep your environment clean, use the
@ref{28b,,Virtual test environment} instead.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

Run the entire test suite:

@example
$ make test
@end example

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
Tests which can't be run because of missing tools are gracefully skipped.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

You may also run a specific subset of test cases by passing an ERT selector
expression.  The following example runs all tests for C and C++, except those
whose name matches @code{gcc}:

@example
$ make ERTSELECTOR='(and (or (tag language-c) (tag language-c++)) (not "gcc"))' test
@end example

See @ref{Test Selectors,,,ert} for the syntax of test selectors.

You can also use a different Emacs to run the tests with:

@example
$ make EMACS=emacs-snapshot test
@end example

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
Keep in mind that you must quote the expression for your shell @emph{and} for
Emacs Lisp.

@node Virtual test environment,Travis CI,Test running,Testing Flycheck
@anchor{contrib/testing id2}@anchor{28c}@anchor{contrib/testing virtual-test-environment}@anchor{28b}
@section Virtual test environment


To run all tests successfully, you need a large amount of external tools.  To
keep your environment clean, and test against a reference environment, Flycheck
provides a virtual machine with a complete test environment, based on VirtualBox
and Vagrant.

The virtual machine contains


@itemize -

@item 
The latest stable Emacs release

@item 
A nightly build of Emacs trunk

@item 
@code{make} and Cask@footnote{http://cask.readthedocs.org}

@item 
All syntax checkers supported by Flycheck
@end itemize

To use this VM, first install the following tools on your system:


@itemize -

@item 
VirtualBox@footnote{https://www.virtualbox.org/}

@item 
Vagrant@footnote{https://www.vagrantup.com/}

@item 
Ansible@footnote{http://www.ansible.com/home}
@end itemize

On Linux, these packages are typically available from the package manager of
your distribution.  On OS X, use the binaries provided for Vagrant and
VirtualBox, and install Ansible from Homebrew@footnote{http://brew.sh/} with @code{brew install ansible}.

To start the VM run the following command in the root directory of Flycheck:

@example
$ vagrant up
@end example

@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
On the first time, this command will setup and provision the VM, and
@strong{download and install over 1GB} of images and packages along the way.
Depending on your network connection and disk speed, this can take an hour or
more.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

After the VM is started, you can connect to it:

@example
$ vagrant ssh
@end example

This will give you a bash prompt within the VM, on which you can run the tests
as explained in @ref{289,,Test running}.

To switch between Emacs versions, pass @code{EMACS} to @code{make test}:

@example
$ make EMACS=emacs24 test
$ make EMACS=emacs-snapshot test
@end example

The latter is the default.

When finished, you can shutdown the VM with:

@example
$ vagrant halt
@end example

Occasionally you should provision the test environment again, to update to the
latest Emacs nightly build, and to follow updates of syntax checker tools.  To
do so, use the @code{--provision} flag when starting the VM:

@example
$ vagrant up --provision
@end example

You can also provision a running machine with:

@example
$ vagrant provision
@end example

The VM is provisioned from Ansible playbooks in the @code{playbooks/} sub-directory
of the top-level source directory.

@node Travis CI,,Virtual test environment,Testing Flycheck
@anchor{contrib/testing homebrew}@anchor{28d}@anchor{contrib/testing travis-ci}@anchor{28e}
@section Travis CI


The entire test suite continuously runs on @ref{28e,,Travis CI} after every push, with
the latest Emacs release and a nightly Emacs snapshot.

Travis CI is configured from @code{.travis.yml} in the top-level source directory,
and uses mostly the same playbooks for provisioning.

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
Travis CI is the @strong{reference environment} for Flycheck's test suite.  All
tests @strong{must pass} on Travis CI.

In case Travis CI diverges from the @ref{28b,,VM},

@section Build environment setup


Flycheck's documentation is written using Sphinx@footnote{http://sphinx-doc.org} and sphinxcontrib-emacs@footnote{http://sphinxcontrib-emacs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/}.  To
build the documentation locally, you need to install these tools first.  This
section guides you through the process of installing them.

First make sure, that you have Python 2.7 and virtualenv@footnote{http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/} available.  To install
virtualenv, use:

@example
$ pip install --user virtualenv
@end example

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
You probably need to install pip@footnote{https://pip.pypa.io/} first. It is available in the package
repositories of most Linux distributions, as @code{python-pip} or similar. If
@code{pip} is not available for your Linux distribution, or if you are using OS
X, please follow the instructions to install pip@footnote{https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html}.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

Then add @code{~/Library/Python/2.7/bin} (on OS X) or @code{~/.local/bin} (on other
Unix variants) to @code{$PATH}.

Now create a virtual environment and install the requirements of the
documentation:

@example
$ mkdir -p ~/.virtualenvs
$ virtualenv -p python2.7 ~/.virtualenvs/cask
$ pip install -r doc/requirements.txt
@end example

Now you are set up to build the documentation.

First, switch to the virtual environment you created in the
@ref{291,,Build environment setup}, and make sure that the requirements are up to date:

@example
$ source ~/.virtualenvs/cask/bin/activate
$ pip install -r doc/requirements.txt
@end example

Now build the documentation:

@example
$ make html
$ make texinfo

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

@chapter GNU Free Documentation License


@example

                GNU Free Documentation License
                 Version 1.3, 3 November 2008


 Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit 
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, 
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license 
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in 
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this 
License, and if all works that were first published under this License 
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or 
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and 
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
