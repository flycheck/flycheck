@section Declaration of syntax checkers

Checkers are declared with @code{flycheck-declare-checker}:

@defmac flycheck-declare-checker symbol docstring &rest properties
Declare SYMBOL as new syntax checker with PROPERTIES.

DOCSTRING provides documentation for the syntax checker.

The PROPERTIES specify the new syntax checker:

@table @code
@item :command '(@var{executable} @var{arguments}...)
A list providing the command to execute.  The command consists of an
@var{executable} specified as string in the @code{car}, and the
@var{arguments} for this executable in the @code{cdr}.  @xref{List
elements, , ,elisp}, for more information about the elements of a list.

The @var{executable} is checked for existence with
@code{executable-find} before executing the syntax checker.

In @var{arguments}, various special symbols are substituted before
executing the syntax checker:

@table @code
@item source
@itemx source-inplace
These symbols are substituted with the file to check.  This file is a
temporary file with the contents of the buffer.  With @code{source} the
copy is created in the temporary directory of the system.  This is
@emph{recommended}.

With @code{source-inplace} the temporary files is created in the same
directory as the buffer's file.  Use this, if the syntax check needs
other files from the source directory.  If the buffer has no
@code{buffer-file-name}, @code{source-inplace} is the same as
@code{source}.

@item source-original
This symbol is substituted with @code{buffer-file-name}, or an empty
string, if the buffer has no file name.  Note that if the buffer is
modified, the content of the file is @b{not up to date} with the actual
content of the buffer.  Hence do @b{not} use this as primary input to a
syntax checker!

See the declaration of the @code{emacs-lisp-checkdoc} syntax checker for
an application of this symbol.

@item (config @var{option} @var{variable})
This cell is substituted with a configuration file for the syntax
checker.  @var{option} is a string containing the option that specifies
a configuration file to the syntax checker tool.

@var{variable} is a symbol referring to a variable from which to obtain
the name or path of the configuration file.  @xref{Configuration}, for
more information about syntax checker configuration.  Define this
variable with @code{flycheck-def-config-file-var}.

If the configuration file is found according to the rules documented in
@ref{Configuration}, the symbol is substituted with the @var{option} and
the absolute path to the configuration file as string.  Otherwise the
symbol is simply dropped from the arguments of the syntax checker.
@end table

This property is @b{mandatory}.

@item :error-parser '@var{parser}
An error parser to use for parsing the output of the syntax checker.

The @var{parser} is a function symbol.  @xref{Error parsers}, for more
information about error parsers, including a list of built-in error
parsers.

Using a error parser is preferred if a syntax checker provides a
structured output format like XML or JSON.  If possible, re-use one of
the built-in error parsers listed in @ref{Error parsers}

May not be specified together with @code{:error-patterns}.

@item :error-patterns '((@var{regexp} @var{level})...)
A list of one or more error patterns to parse the output of
@code{:command}.

The @var{regexp} is a regular expression matching a single error or
warning.  The @var{level} is either @code{error} or @code{warning} and
classifies the severity of the matched error message.

Do @b{not} use error patterns if you can use an error parser.

The @var{regexp} may provide the following match groups:

@table @emph
@item Group 1
The file name.
@item Group 2
The line number.
@item Group 3
The column number.
@item Group 4
The error text.
@end table

Each of these groups is optional, however error messages without line
numbers will be ignored.  Use @b{explicitly numbered groups} to make
sure that the group numbering is correct.  @xref{Regexp Backslash, ,
,elisp}, for more information about regular expression groups.

The patterns are applied in the order of declaration to the whole output
of the syntax checker.  Output already matched by a pattern will not be
matched by subsequent patterns.  In other words, the first pattern wins.

May not be specified together with @code{:error-parser}.

@item :modes '@var{major-mode}
@itemx :modes '(@var{major-mode}...)
A single @var{major-mode}, or a list thereof.

@var{major-mode} is a symbol referring to a major mode.  If given the
syntax checker will only be used in buffers with any of the given major
modes.

@item :predicate @var{form}
A predicate that determines whether the syntax checker may be used.

@var{form} is a quoted Emacs Lisp form.  It is evaluated before each
syntax check to determine whether the syntax checker may be used for the
current buffer.  If @var{form} evaluates to nil, the syntax checker is
not used.

If @var{:modes} is given, @var{FORM} is only evaluated if the major mode
matches.  Otherwise the syntax checker is not used.

@item :next-checker '(@var{item}...)
A list of syntax checker to run after this syntax checker.

Each @var{item} is either a single syntax checker symbol, or a cons cell
@code{(@var{predicate} . @var{checker})}.  Each @var{item} is tried on
the order of declaration.

If the @var{item} is a syntax checker symbol, determine whether it is
usable @b{and} registered (i.e. contained in @code{flycheck-checkers}).
If so start a new syntax check with that syntax checker, and merged its
results with the results of this syntax checker.  If not, try the next
@var{item}.

If @var{item} is a cons cell, @var{predicate} specifies whether to run
the @var{checker} depending on the results of this syntax checker:

@table @code
@item no-errors
The @var{CHECKER} is only used if this syntax checker resulted in no
errors at all.
@item warnings-only
The @var{CHECKER} is only used if this syntax checker did not result in
error messages of severity @code{error}.
@end table

If the predicate matches, and @var{checker} is usable and registered,
start a new syntax checker with @var{checker} and merged its results
with the results of this syntax checker.  If not, try the next
@var{item}.

If there is no further @var{item}, finish the syntax check.
@end table

At least on of @code{:modes} and @code{:predicate} must be present.  If
both are present, both must match for the syntax checker to be used.

Either @code{:error-patterns} or @code{:error-parser} must be present.
If both are present, an error is signaled.
@end defmac

A syntax checker declared with @code{flycheck-declare-checker} is
already suitable for manual checker selection with
@code{flycheck-select-checker}.  For automatic selection the syntax
checker must be registered by adding it to @code{flycheck-checkers}.
@xref{Selection}.

@defmac flycheck-def-config-file-var @var{symbol} @var{checker} @
  &optional @var{filename}
Define @var{symbol} as configuration file variable for a syntax
@var{checker}, with a default value of @var{filename}.

@var{symbol} is declared as customizable variable using
@code{defcustom}, to provide a configuration file for the given syntax
@var{checker}.  The variable has the customization type @code{string},
and gets a comprehensive docstring, including a reference to
@var{checker}.

@var{filename} is used as initial value for the variable.  If omitted,
the initial value is nil.

Use this macro together with the @code{config} cell in the command of a
syntax checker.

@section Error parsers

Syntax checkers may use more sophisticated error parsing by using the
@code{:error-parser} property.  @xref{Declaration}.

Flycheck provides the following error parsers for use by syntax
checkers:

@table @code
@item flycheck-parse-checkstyle
Parse XML output similar to @uref{http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/,
Checkstyle}.
@end table

You may also define your own error parsers.  An error parser is a
function that takes three arguments:

@table @var
@item output
The complete output of the syntax checker as string.
@item checker
A symbol denoting the executed syntax checker.
@item buffer
A buffer object referring to the buffer that was syntax-checked.
@end table

The function shall return a list of Flycheck errors.  @xref{Error API},
for more information about Flycheck errors.

Flycheck provides some utility functions to implement error parsers.
@xref{Error parser API}.

@subsection Basic syntax checkers

As explained in the previous chapter @ref{Extending} a syntax checker is
declared with @code{flycheck-declare-checker}.

We will use this function to declare a syntax checker using the
CodeSniffer utility for the PHP programming language:

@lisp
(flycheck-declare-checker php-phpcs
  "A PHP syntax checker using PHP_CodeSniffer.

See URL `http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer/'."
  :command '("phpcs" "--report=checkstyle" source)
  :error-parser 'flycheck-parse-checkstyle
  :modes '(php-mode php+-mode))
@end lisp

First we specify the @code{:command} to execute.  The first element of
the command list is the name of the executable, @command{phpcs} in our
case.  This command is checked for existence with @code{executable-find}
before using this syntax checker.  If the command does not exist, the
syntax checker is @emph{not} used.

The executable is following by the arguments, in this case some options
and the symbol @code{source}.  This symbol is replaced with the file to
check.  This file is a temporary file created in the system temporary
directory and containing the contents of the buffer to check.

Next we specify how to parse the output of the syntax checker.  PHP
CodeSniffer provides an option to output errors in an XML format similar
to the Java tool Checkstyle, so we use the built-in @emph{error parser}
@code{flycheck-parse-checkstyle} to parse the output.

Eventually we enable the syntax checker in PHP editing modes.

If the syntax checker does not provide any sort of structured output
format, we have to parse the error messages from the textual output.  To
do so, we can use @emph{error patterns}, like in the Pylint syntax
checker for the Python programming language:

@lisp
(flycheck-declare-checker python-pylint
  "A Python syntax and style checker using the pylint utility.

See URL `http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint'."
  :command '("epylint" source-inplace)
  :error-patterns
  '(("^\\(?1:.*\\):\\(?2:[0-9]+\\): Warning (W.*): \\(?4:.*\\)$" warning)
    ("^\\(?1:.*\\):\\(?2:[0-9]+\\): Error (E.*): \\(?4:.*\\)$" error)
    ("^\\(?1:.*\\):\\(?2:[0-9]+\\): \\[F\\] \\(?4:.*\\)$" error))
  :modes 'python-mode)
@end lisp

Again, there is a @code{:command}, however we use the
@code{source-inplace} symbol this time.  This symbol causes the
temporary file to be created in the same directory as the original file,
making information from the source code tree available to the syntax
checker.  In case of Pylint, these are the Python packages from the
source code tree.

Next we give the list of @emph{error patterns} to parse errors.  These
patterns extract the error location and the error message from the
output of @command{epylint}.  An error pattern is a list containing a
regular expression with match groups to extract the error information,
and an error level (either @code{warning} or @code{error}).

Eventually we enable the syntax checker in @code{python-mode}.

@node Predicate example, Configuration example, Simple example, Examples
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@subsection Syntax checkers with predicates

In the previous examples the syntax checkers were specific to certain
major modes.  However, this is not always the case.  For instance, GNU
Emacs provides a single mode only for shell scripting in various Shell
languages.  A syntax checker for a specific shell must check whether the
edited shell script is written for the right shell:

@lisp
(flycheck-declare-checker zsh
  "A Zsh syntax checker using the zsh executable.

See URL `http://www.zsh.org/'."
  :command '("zsh" "-n" "-d" "-f" source)
  :error-patterns '(("^\\(?1:.*\\):\\(?2:[0-9]+\\): \\(?4:.*\\)$" error))
  :modes 'sh-mode
  :predicate '(eq sh-shell 'zsh))
@end lisp

This syntax checker for the Zsh shell is enabled in @code{sh-mode} as
specified by @code{:modes}, however it specifies an additional
@code{:predicate} to determine whether the right shell is in use.  Hence
this syntax checker is only used if a Zsh shell scripting is being
edited in @code{sh-mode}, but not if a Bash or POSIX Shell script is
being edited.

A syntax checker may even go as far as not having @code{:modes} at all.
For instance, there is no special JSON mode, but syntax checking JSON is
still desirable.  Hence a JSON syntax checker may use the
@code{:predicate} to check the file extension:

@lisp

(flycheck-declare-checker json-jsonlint
  "A JSON syntax and style checker using jsonlint.

See URL `https://github.com/zaach/jsonlint'."
  :command '("jsonlint" "-c" "-q" source)
  :error-patterns
  '(("^\\(?1:.+\\)\: line \\(?2:[0-9]+\\), col \\(?3:[0-9]+\\), \\(?4:.+\\)$"
     error))
  :predicate '(and buffer-file-name
                   (string= "json" (file-name-extension buffer-file-name)))))
@end lisp

This syntax checker is now used whenever a file ends with .json,
regardless of the major mode.

@node Configuration example, Chaining example, Predicate example, Examples
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@subsection Configuration files for syntax checkers

Some syntax checkers can be configured using configuration files given
by an option.  Flycheck provides built-in support to handle such
configuration files:

@lisp
(flycheck-def-config-file-var flycheck-jshintrc javascript-jshint ".jshintrc")

(flycheck-declare-checker javascript-jshint
  "A JavaScript syntax and style checker using jshint.

See URL `http://www.jshint.com'."
  :command '("jshint" "--checkstyle-reporter"
             (config "--config" flycheck-jshintrc) source)
  :error-parser 'flycheck-parse-checkstyle
  :modes '(js-mode js2-mode js3-mode))
@end lisp

As you can see, we declare a syntax checker for Javascript, using the
@command{jshint} utility.  This utility accepts a configuration file via
the @option{--config} option.

To use a configuration file with jshint, we first declare the variable
@code{flycheck-jshintrc} that provides the name of the file, as
explained in @ref{Configuration}.

In the @code{:command} we use a @code{config} element to pass the
configuration file to the syntax checker.  If the configuration file is
found, its path will be passed to the syntax checker, using the option
specified after the @code{config} symbol.  Otherwise the whole element
is simply omitted from the command line.

@node Chaining example,  , Configuration example, Examples
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@subsection Chaining syntax checkers

For many languages, more than a single syntax checker is applicable.
For instance, Emacs Lisp can be checked for syntactic corrections with
the byte code compiler, and for adherence to the Emacs Lisp
documentation style using Checkdoc.  PHP, too, can be syntax checked
with the PHP parser, and verified against coding styles using PHP
CodeSniffer.

To support such cases, syntax checkers can be @dfn{chained} using the
@code{:next-checkers}.  The standard PHP syntax checker uses this to
run PHP CodeSniffer if there are no syntax errors:

@lisp
(flycheck-declare-checker php
  "A PHP syntax checker using the PHP command line.

See URL `http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.php'."
  :command '("php" "-l" "-d" "error_reporting=E_ALL" "-d" "display_errors=1"
             "-d" "log_errors=0" source)
  :error-patterns
  '(("\\(?:Parse\\|Fatal\\|syntax\\) error[:,] \\(?4:.*\\) in \\(?1:.*\\) on line \\(?2:[0-9]+\\)"
    error))
  :modes '(php-mode php+-mode)
  :next-checkers '((warnings-only . php-phpcs)))
@end lisp

Now PHP CodeSniffer will check the coding style, whenever a PHP syntax
check did not result in any errors, if PHP CodeSniffer syntax checker is
usable @emph{and} registered.
