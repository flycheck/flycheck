 Flycheck — Syntax checking for GNU Emacs
==========================================

**Flycheck** is a modern on-the-fly syntax checking extension for GNU Emacs,
intended as replacement for the older Flymake extension which is part of GNU
Emacs.  For a detailed comparison to Flymake see :ref:`flycheck-versus-flymake`.

It uses various syntax checking and linting tools to :ref:`automatically check
the contents of buffers <flycheck-syntax-checks>` while you type, and reports
warnings and errors directly in the buffer, or in an optional :ref:`error list
<flycheck-error-list>`:

Out of the box Flycheck supports over :ref:`40 different programming languages
<flycheck-languages>` with more than 80 different syntax checking tools, and
comes with a :ref:`simple interface <flycheck-developers-guide>` to define new
syntax checkers.

Many :ref:`3rd party extensions <flycheck-extensions>` provide new syntax
checkers and other features like alternative error displays or mode line
indicators.

Try out
=======

Flycheck needs GNU Emacs |min-emacs|, and works best on Unix systems.  **Windows
users**, please be aware that Flycheck does not support Windows officially,
although it should mostly work fine on Windows.  See :ref:`Windows support
<flycheck-windows-support>` and watch out for `known Windows issues`_!

To try Flycheck in your Emacs session install some :ref:`syntax checker tools
<flycheck-languages>` and type the following in your ``*scratch*`` buffer and
run ``M-x eval-buffer``:

.. code-block:: cl

   (require 'package)
   (add-to-list 'package-archives
                '("MELPA Stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
   (package-initialize)
   (package-refresh-contents)

   (package-install 'flycheck)

   (global-flycheck-mode)

*On MacOS* also add the following to :ref:`fix your $PATH environment variable
<flycheck-macos-exec-path-from-shell>`:

.. code-block:: cl

   (package-install 'exec-path-from-shell)
   (exec-path-from-shell-initialize)

For a permanent installation of Flycheck follow the :ref:`Installation
<flycheck-installation>` instructions.  For a gentle introduction into Flycheck
features go through :ref:`Quickstart <flycheck-quickstart>` guide.

.. important::

   If Flycheck fails to run properly or gives you any error messages please take
   a look at the :ref:`troubleshooting section <flycheck-troubleshooting>` which
   covers some common setup issues and helps you debug and fix problems with
   Flycheck.
