 Recommended extensions
========================

The Emacs community has produced a number of extensions to Flycheck.  This page
lists all that we know of and can safely recommend to our users.

*Official* extensions are (co-)maintained by the :ref:`Flycheck maintainers
<flycheck-maintainers>` who will take care to update official extensions in case
of breaking changes in Flycheck and work to provide extra API for extensions if
needed.  If you'd like to make your extension an *official* one and move it into
the `Flycheck Github organisation`_ please contact a :ref:`maintainer
<flycheck-maintainers>`.

If you do know extensions not in this list, or would like to see your own
extension here, please feel free to `add it`_.

We would like to thank all people who created and contributed to Flycheck
extensions for their awesome work.  Without your help and support Flycheck would
not be what it is today.
