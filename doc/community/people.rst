We maintain Flycheck and all official extensions within the `Flycheck
organisation`_, and set the direction and scope of Flycheck.  We review and
accept pull requests and feature proposals and fix bugs in Flycheck.

Emphasized users are also owners of the `Flycheck Organisation`_, and thus have
administrative privileges for all repositories in Flycheck.  Notably only owners
can currently make Flycheck releases, and their GPG keys sign release tags for
Flycheck.

Mention with ``@flycheck/maintainers``.

Our moderators help uphold our :doc:`conduct`.  Currently, we do not have a

moderators in our Github organisation and in our official communication
channels.

Packagers
=========

We would like to thank all people who package Flycheck on behalf of
distributions and support our development efforts with their feedback, their
patches and their testing:

* Sean Whitton (:gh:`spwhitton`) and the `Debian Emacs addon team`_ (Debian
  packages)

Acknowledgements
================

We would also like to thank the following people and projects:

* Sebastian Wiesner (:gh:`lunaryorn`) for creating Flycheck in the first place,
  for taking the time and dedication to maintain it for over 4 years, while
  maintaining high standards of code quality and nurturing an healthy, active
  community around it, giving Flycheck the best chances to thrive after his
  departure.
* Bozhidar Batsov (:gh:`bbatsov`) for his valuable feedback and his constant
  support and endorsement of Flycheck from the very beginning. Notably he added
  Flycheck to his popular :gh:`Prelude <bbatsov/prelude>` project at a very
  early stage and thus brought Flycheck to many new users.
* Magnar Sveen (:gh:`magnars`) for his :gh:`dash.el <magnars/dash.el>` and
  :gh:`s.el <magnars/s.el>` libraries, which support considerable parts of
  Flycheck internals, and greatly helped to overcome Sebastian’s initial
  aversion to Emacs Lisp.
* Martin Grenfell (:gh:`scrooloose`) for the Vim syntax checking extension
  :gh:`Syntastic <vim-syntastic/syntastic>` which saved Sebastian’s life back
  when he was using Vim, and served as inspiration for Flycheck and many of its
  syntax checkers.
* Matthias Güdemann (:gh:`mgudemann`), for his invaluable work on
  Flycheck’s logo.
* Pavel Kobyakov for his work on GNU Flymake, which is a great work on
  its own, despite its flaws and weaknesses.
* Simon Carter (:gh:`bbbscarter`), for his patient in-depth testing of automatic
  syntax checking, and his very constructive feedback.
* Steve Purcell (:gh:`purcell`) for his valuable feedback, the fruitful
  discussions and his important ideas about the shape and design of Flycheck,
  and his indispensible and dedicated work on MELPA, which drives the continuous
  distribution of Flycheck to its users.
