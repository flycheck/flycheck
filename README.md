**Flycheck** is a modern on-the-fly syntax checking extension for GNU Emacs 24,
intended as replacement for the older Flymake extension which is part of GNU
Emacs.

It uses various syntax checking and linting tools to
[automatically check the contents of buffers][checking] while you type, and
reports warnings and errors directly in the buffer or in an optional error list
(see [Flycheck manual][manual] for more information):

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flycheck/flycheck/master/doc/images/flycheck-annotated.png)

Out of the box Flycheck supports over
[40 different programming languages][languages] with more than 80 different
syntax checking tools, and comes with a [simple interface][definitions] to
define new syntax checkers.

Many [3rd party extensions](http://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/community/extensions.html) provide
new syntax checkers and other features like alternative error displays or mode
line indicators.

## Quickstart ##

Flycheck needs GNU Emacs 24.1 or newer, and works best on Unix systems.
**Windows users**, please be aware that Flycheck does not support Windows
officially, although it should mostly work fine on Windows.  See
[Windows support][] and watch out for [known Windows issues][windows issues]!

Install some [syntax checker tools][languages] and type the following in your
`*scratch*` buffer and run `M-x eval-buffer`:

```lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)

(package-install 'flycheck)

(global-flycheck-mode)
```
