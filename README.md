**Flycheck** is a modern on-the-fly syntax checking extension for GNU Emacs 24,
intended as replacement for the older Flymake extension which is part of GNU
Emacs.

It uses various syntax checking and linting tools to check the contents of
buffers, and reports warnings and errors directly in the buffer, or in an
optional error list.  The following screenshow shows Flycheck at work in a
Haskell buffer, using GHC and Hlint for syntax checking:

The color theme in this screencast is [Solarized Light][], with the the
[Source Code Pro][] font.

- Nice error indication and highlighting
- Optional error list popup
- Many customization options
- A [comprehensive manual][manual]
- A simple interface to define new syntax checkers
- A “doesn't get in your way” guarantee
- Many [3rd party extensions](http://flycheck.org/extensions.html)

Installation
------------

Flycheck needs GNU Emacs 24 on a Unix system, and additionally **external**
syntax checking programs for the languages you use.  See [Supported Languages][]
for more information.

Flycheck does not officially support Windows, but tries to maintain Windows
compatibility and should generally work fine on Windows, too.

Install Flycheck from [MELPA][] or [MELPA Stable][] with:

    M-x package-install RET flycheck

In your [Cask][] file:

    (source gnu)
    (source melpa)

    (depends-on "flycheck")

Then add the following to your init file:

    (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)

If you don’t know where your init file is, look at the value of the variable
`user-init-file` with `C-h v user-init-file`.

See [Installation][] and [Quick start][] for more information.
