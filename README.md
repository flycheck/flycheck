Flycheck [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lunaryorn/flycheck.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lunaryorn/flycheck)
========

Flycheck (aka “Flymake done right”) is a modern on-the-fly syntax checking
extension for GNU Emacs 24 with:

- ready-to-use syntax checkers for a bunch of languages,
- easy customization,
- a comprehensive manual,
- a dead simple, declarative API to create new syntax checkers,
- major-mode based selection of syntax checkers,
- multiple syntax checkers per buffer,
- optional error list popup,
- a “doesn’t get in your way” guarantee,
- and a clean, concise and understandable implementation with decent test
  coverage.

color theme and the great [Anonymous Pro][anon-pro] font.

### 3rd party extensions

The following extensions provide additional cool features for Flycheck:

- [flycheck-color-mode-line.el][] colors the mode line according to the Flycheck
  status.


Installation
------------

Install the ELPA package from [MELPA][] or [Marmalade][] with `M-x
package-install RET flycheck`.  All dependencies are automatically installed.

Flycheck supports GNU Emacs 24.2 and newer on Linux, OS X and any other decent
flavor of Unix.  It should work with GNU Emacs 24.1, too, but it is not tested
against this version of Emacs.

Flycheck does not support Windows, but tries to be compatible with it.  You may
try to use Flycheck on Windows.  It should mostly work, but expect problems and
issues.  Pull requests which improve Windows compatibility are welcome.

Flycheck also does not support GNU Emacs 23 and other flavors of Emacs
(e.g. XEmacs, Aquamacs, etc.).  Don't try, it will *not* work.

Most checkers have dependencies against external tools that perform the
checking.  Use `C-c ! ?` to see what a checker needs, e.g. `C-c ! ?
python-pylint`.


Usage
-----

Once installed, enable Flycheck mode with `M-x flycheck-mode`.

To enable Flycheck mode in all buffers, in which it can be used, add the
following to your `init.el` file:

```scheme
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)
```

In Flycheck mode the buffer will automatically be checked on the fly, if a
suitable syntax checker exists.  Use `C-c ! c` to start a syntax check manually.

A suitable syntax checker is automatically selected from the list of registered
checkers in `flycheck-checkers`.  Use  `C-c ! s` to manually select a specific
syntax checker, or configure the syntax checker per file by setting
`flycheck-checker` as file local variable::

```python
# Local Variables:
# flycheck-checker: python-pylint
# End:
```

Some syntax checkers read configuration files.  Use `M-x customize-group RET
flycheck-config-files` to customize these.  Refer to the section *Configuration*
in the Flycheck info manual.

Errors and warnings from the syntax checker are reported in the mode line,
highlighted in the buffer and indicated with icons in the fringe.  Customize
`flycheck-highlighting-mode` to change the highlighting of errors.

**Note:** The default highlighting faces provided GNU Emacs are ill-suited to
highlight errors.  They are too easily overlooked.  Make sure to customize these
faces to add a striking background color or an underlying, or choose a color
theme with reasonable Flycheck faces, for instance the excellent light or dark
[solarized][] themes.

Use `C-c ! n` and `C-c ! p` to navigate between errors.  If the point is on an
error, the error message is shown in the echo area or in a popup buffer after a
short delay.  You may also hover the mouse over a highlighted error to get a
tooltip with the error message.

Read the complete manual with `C-c ! i` or `M-x flycheck-info`.
