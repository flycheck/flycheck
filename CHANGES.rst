======================

- Bugs Fixed

33.0 (2024-02-04)
=======================

.. note:: The changelog for this release is incomplete.

- New features and improvements

  - The ``flycheck-verify-setup`` UI now includes buttons to re-enable manually
    disabled checkers and to try to re-enable automatically disabled checkers
    (command checkers are automatically disabled when their executable cannot be
    found). [GH-1755]
  - Error explainers can now return URLs (to show a webpage) or functions (to
    use custom formatting).  For example, the Rust checker now renders
    explanations using ``markdown-view-mode``. [GH-1753]
  - Enable checkers in many newer TreeSitter-based major modes (think ``*-ts-mode``).

- New syntax checkers

  - Python with ``ruff``. [GH-2033]

- **Breaking changes**

  - Drop support for Emacs 25.
  - The variable ``flycheck-current-errors`` now contains errors in the order in
    which they were returned by checkers.  In previous versions of Flycheck,
    this list was sorted by error position and severity. [GH-1749]

32 (frozen on May 3rd, 2020, released Mar 28, 2022)
===================================================

- Highlights

  - Many checkers and compiler, such as ``ocaml``, ``rust``, ``eslint``, and
    others, include end-line and end-column information.  Flycheck can now
    highlight the exact region that they report.  Authors of checker definitions
    can use the new ``:end-line`` and ``:end-column`` arguments in
    ``flycheck-error-new``, or the new ``end-line`` and ``end-column`` fields in
    error patterns. [GH-1400]

  - Errors that checkers return for other files will now be displayed on the
    first line of the current buffer instead of begin discarded.  The error list
    indicates which file each error came from, and navigation moves
    automatically moves between files.  This change helps with compiled
    languages, where an error in another file may cause the current file to be
    considered invalid.  Variables ``flycheck-relevant-error-other-file-show``
    and ``flycheck-relevant-error-other-file-minimum-level`` control this
    behavior. [GH-1427]

  - Flycheck can now draw error indicators in margins in addition to fringes.
    Margins can contain arbitrary characters and images, not just monochrome
    bitmaps, allowing for a better experience on high-DPI screens.
    ``flycheck-indication-mode`` controls this behavior, and
    ``flycheck-set-indication-mode`` can be used to automatically adjust the
    fringes and margins.  Additionally, Flycheck's will now use high-resolution
    fringe bitmaps if the fringe is wide enough [GH-1742, GH-1744]

  - Error highlighting is now configurable, using the new
    ``flycheck-highlighting-style`` variable: instead of applying
    level-dependent faces (typically with wavy underlines), Flycheck can now
    insert delimiters around errors, or mix styles depending on how many lines
    an error covers.  Additionally, stipples are added in the fringes to
    indicate errors that span multiple lines. [GH-1743]

- New features and improvements

  - Flycheck can now trigger a syntax check automatically after switching
    buffers, using the ``idle-buffer-switch`` option in
    ``flycheck-check-syntax-automatically``.  This is useful when errors in a
    file are due to problems in a separate file.  Variables
    ``flycheck-idle-buffer-switch-delay`` and
    ``flycheck-buffer-switch-check-intermediate-buffers`` control the
    functionality. [GH-1297]
  - Flycheck will now use Emacs' native XML parsing when libXML fails.  This
    behavior can be changed by customizing ``flycheck-xml-parser``. [GH-1349]
  - ``flycheck-verify-setup`` now shows more clearly which checkers
    will run in the buffer, and which are misconfigured. [GH-1478]
  - Flycheck now locates checker executables using a customizable function,
    ``flycheck-executable-find``.  The default value of this function allows
    relative paths (set e.g. in file or dir-local variables) in addition to
    absolute paths and executable names. [GH-1485]
  - Checkers that report error positions as a single offset from the start of
    the file can use the new ``flycheck-error-new-at-pos`` constructor instead
    of converting that position to a line and a column. [GH-1400]
  - Config-file variables can now be set to a list of file names.  This is
    useful for checkers like mypy which don't run correctly when called from a
    subdirectory without passing an explicit config file. [GH-1711]
  - Thanks to algorithmic improvements in error reporting, Flycheck is now much
    faster in large buffers. [GH-1750]

- New syntax checkers:

  - Awk with ``gawk`` [GH-1708]
  - Bazel with ``buildifier`` [GH-1613]
  - CUDA with ``cuda-nvcc`` [GH-1508]

  - mypy with ``python-mypy`` [GH-1354]
  - Nix with ``nix-linter`` [GH-1530]
  - Opam with ``opam lint`` [GH-1532]
  - protobuf-prototool with ``prototool`` [GH-1591]
  - Rust with ``rust-clippy`` [GH-1385]
  - Ruumba with ``eruby-ruumba`` [GH-1616]
  - Staticcheck with ``go-staticheck`` [GH-1541]

  - Tcl with ``nagelfar`` [GH-1365]
  - Text prose with ``textlint`` [GH-1534]
  - VHDL with ``ghdl`` [GH-1160]

- Checker improvements:

  - ``python-pylint`` and ``python-flake8`` are now invoked with ``python -c``,
    to make it easier to change between Python 2 and Python 3. [GH-1113]
  - Add ``flycheck-perl-module-list`` to use specified modules when
    syntax checking code with the ``perl`` checker. [GH-1207]
  - ``rust-cargo`` now uses ``cargo check`` and ``cargo test``. [GH-1289]
  - Add ``flycheck-ghc-stack-project-file`` for the
    ``haskell-stack-ghc`` checker. [GH-1316]
  - Add ``flycheck-cppcheck-suppressions-file`` to pass a suppressions
    file to cppcheck. [GH-1329]
  - Add ``--force-exclusion`` flag to ``rubocop`` command. [GH-1348]
  - Flycheck now uses ESLint's JSON output instead of checkstyle XML. [GH-1350]
  - Add ``flychjeck-eslint-args`` to pass arguments to ``javascript-eslint``.
    [GH-1360]
  - Flycheck will now execute ``rubocop`` from the directory where a ``Gemfile``
    is located. If a ``Gemfile`` does not exist, the old behaviour of running
    the command from the directory where ``.rubocop.yml`` is found will be
    used. [GH-1368]
  - Add ``flycheck-sh-bash-args`` to pass arguments to ``sh-bash``. [GH-1439]
  - ``haskell-stack-ghc`` will not try to install GHC anymore. [GH-1443]
  - Add ``flycheck-ghdl-ieee-library`` to select which standard IEEE
    library to use for ghdl. [GH-1547]
  - The ``javascript-eslint`` checker now supports ``typescript-mode`` by
    default.
  - Add ``flycheck-erlang-rebar3-profile`` to select which profile to
    use when compiling erlang with rebar3. [GH-1560]
  - Add ``flycheck-relevant-error-other-file-show`` to avoid showing errors
    from other files. [GH-1579]
  - The ``nix-linter`` checker now has an error explainer. [GH-1586]
  - The Emacs Lisp checker can now run in buffers not backed by files. [GH-1695]

- **Breaking changes**

  - Remove the ``javascript-jscs`` checker. [GH-1024]
  - Remove the ``elixir-dogma`` checker. [GH-1450]
  - ``rust-cargo`` now requires Rust 1.17 or newer. [GH-1289]
  - ``rust`` now requires 1.18 or newer. [GH-1501]
  - Rename ``flycheck-cargo-rustc-args`` to ``flycheck-cargo-check-args``.
    [GH-1289]
  - ``rust-cargo`` does not use the variable ``flycheck-rust-args`` anymore.
    [GH-1289]
  - Improve detection of default directory for ``haskell-ghc`` to consider
    ``hpack`` project files. [GH-1435]
  - Replace ``go tool vet`` with ``go vet``. [GH-1548]
  - Remove the deprecated ``go-megacheck`` checker, which is replaced by
    ``go-staticcheck``. [GH-1583]

26 (Apr 27, 2016)
=================

Flycheck now has a `Code of Conduct`_ which defines the acceptable behaviour and
the moderation guidelines for the Flycheck community. [GH-819]

Flycheck also provides a `Gitter channel`_ now for questions and discussions
about development. [GH-820]

The native Texinfo manual is again replaced with a Sphinx_ based documentation.
We hope that this change makes the manual easier to edit and to maintain and
more welcoming for new contributors.  The downside is that we can not longer
include a Info manual in Flycheck’s MELPA packages.

From this release onward Flycheck will use a single continuously increasing
version number.  Breaking changes may occur at any point.
