The following people greatly supported Flycheck in other ways:

- `Simon Carter <https://github.com/bbbscarter>`_ (valuable testing and feedback
  of automatic syntax checking)
- `Matthias Güdemann <https://github.com/mgudemann>`_ (initial version of the
  Flycheck logo, valuable feedback for the final version)

The Flycheck developers would also like to thank the following people and
projects:

- `Bozhidar Batsov`_ for his valuable feedback and his constant support and
  endorsement of Flycheck from the very beginning.  Notably, he added Flycheck
  to his popular Prelude_ project at a very early stage and thus brought
  Flycheck to many new users.
- `Magnar Sveen`_ for his `dash.el`_ and `s.el`_ libraries, which support
  considerable parts of Flycheck internals, and greatly helped to overcome the
  author's initial aversion to Emacs Lisp.
- `Martin Grenfell <https://github.com/scrooloose>`_ for the Vim syntax checking
  extension Syntastic_, which saved the author's life back when he was using
  Vim, and served as inspiration for Flycheck and many of its syntax checkers.
- Pavel Kobyakov for his work on GNU Flymake, which is a great work on its own,
  despite its flaws and weaknesses
- `Steve Purcell`_ for his valuable feedback, the fruitful discussions and his
  important ideas about the shape and design of Flycheck, and his indispensible
  and dedicated work on MELPA, which drives the continuous distribution of
  Flycheck to its users.
