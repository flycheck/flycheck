;;; Commentary:

;; Test that the contents of `flycheck-checkers' are sane.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)
(require 's)
(require 'flycheck)

(ert-deftest flycheck-checkers-not-empty ()
  "Test that there are any registered checkers."
  (should flycheck-checkers))

(ert-deftest flycheck-checkers-sound ()
  "Test that `flycheck-checkers' is sound.

Any checker in this list should be valid and registered."
  (dolist (checker flycheck-checkers)
    (should (flycheck-valid-checker-p checker))
    (should (flycheck-registered-checker-p checker))))

(ert-deftest flycheck-checkers-complete ()
  "Test that `flycheck-checkers' is complete.

All declared checkers should be registered."
